# Problem 005: Notion API Key Expired

**Status:** Closed (Notion deprecated per Tom, 2026-02-05)
**Reported:** 2026-02-05
**Reporter:** Vultr-Voder
**Priority:** 1 (Minimal) — Impact: Low (1) × Likelihood: Low (1) = 1 → Minimal

## Description

Notion API key returns 401 unauthorized. Vultr-Voder cannot access Notion API.

## Business Impact

Minimal — Tom has deprecated Notion in favor of filesystem. No current workflows depend on Notion.

## Workaround

Use filesystem for all documentation and tracking. Notion is no longer needed.

## Proposed Fix

Do not fix. Notion is deprecated per Tom's decision (2026-02-05). Close this ticket if confirmed unnecessary.
