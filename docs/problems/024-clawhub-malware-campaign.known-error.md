# P-024: ClawHub Malware Campaign (Known-Error)

## Status
**KNOWN-ERROR** — External threat, not a bug in our systems

## Reported
2026-02-06 (Daniel Lockyer tweet, 1Password article)

## Summary
341+ ClawHub skills found distributing macOS infostealer malware via "ClickFix-style" install instructions. Top downloaded "Twitter" skill was a malware delivery vehicle.

## Attack Pattern
1. Skill tells user to install a "prerequisite"
2. Links lead to malicious staging infrastructure
3. Commands decode obfuscated payload
4. Payload downloads macOS binary
5. Binary removes Gatekeeper quarantine, executes infostealer

## Target
- **macOS users** — Binary is macOS-specific
- Users with saved credentials, SSH keys, API tokens, browser sessions

## Our Exposure

### Atlas (Vultr Linux) — LOW RISK
- Linux OS not targeted by this malware
- No ClawHub skills installed
- Built-in skills from OpenClaw package only

### Pilot (Mac) — MEDIUM RISK
- macOS IS the target platform
- Needs skill audit
- Should NOT install any ClawHub skills

### Workspace Skills (Audited)
- `better-notion` — Benign (Notion API curl commands)
- `google-workspace-mcp` — Uses npm package, needs npm audit

## Mitigation
1. Do NOT install skills from ClawHub
2. Audit any existing ClawHub-sourced skills
3. Review any "prerequisite" install commands before executing
4. Mac users: treat as potential incident if any ClawHub skills were installed
