# 001.0-RES-ANCHORING-EXP: Tversky/Kahneman Anchoring Bias Experiment

## Theme Goal

**Theme**: Core Validation (Essential MVP)

Enable researchers to validate the anchoring bias (African countries experiment) exists in one LLM model with basic statistical output. This story establishes the foundational experiment definition that validates whether LLMs exhibit the same cognitive biases as humans in the classic Tversky/Kahneman anchoring experiment.

This is the first capability in the "Design Experiment" journey phase, providing the experimental framework that all subsequent Core Validation stories depend on.

## How This Story Contributes

This story is critical as the foundation of the entire toolkit - it defines the anchoring bias experiment that serves as the reference implementation for all future bias experiments. Without this experiment definition, researchers cannot validate whether LLMs exhibit human-like cognitive biases.

This enables:
- Story 003.0 (Configure conditions with high/low anchors)
- Story 005.0 (Parse numeric estimates from responses)
- Story 006.0 (Run t-test on results)
- The complete Core Validation theme MVP

The anchoring experiment serves as the template and proof-of-concept that guides the implementation of other cognitive bias experiments in later themes.

## User Story

**Format**: So that I can validate LLMs exhibit human-like bias, as a Bias Researcher, I want to implement the Tversky/Kahneman anchoring bias experiment (African countries in the UN).

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: Can be developed independently - defines experiment structure without requiring other stories
- **Negotiable**: Exact prompt wording and question structure can be refined during implementation
- **Valuable**: Delivers core research value - enables validation of cognitive bias in LLMs
- **Estimable**: Scope is clear - implement the two-question anchoring experiment structure
- **Small**: Can be completed within a single iteration - focused on experiment definition
- **Testable**: Acceptance criteria provide clear verification of experiment structure and prompts

## Requirements and Acceptance Criteria

- **REQ-EXP-STRUCTURE**: Experiment implements the classic two-question anchoring format
  - [ ] **Question 1 (Anchor)**: Prompts LLM with comparison question using specific percentage anchor (e.g., "Is the percentage of African countries in the UN higher or lower than X%?")
  - [ ] **Question 2 (Estimate)**: Prompts LLM for best estimate (e.g., "What is your best estimate of the percentage of African countries in the UN?")
  - [ ] **Two Conditions**: Experiment defines both low anchor condition (10%) and high anchor condition (65%)

- **REQ-EXP-PROMPT**: Experiment prompts accurately replicate Tversky/Kahneman methodology
  - [ ] **Anchor Question**: Prompt clearly presents the anchor percentage and asks for comparison
  - [ ] **Estimation Question**: Prompt requests numerical estimate without additional context
  - [ ] **Independence**: Questions are structured to maintain experimental validity (no priming beyond anchor)

- **REQ-EXP-VALIDATION**: Experiment produces statistically analyzable results
  - [ ] **Numeric Response**: Experiment expects and validates numeric percentage responses
  - [ ] **Condition Comparison**: Experiment structure enables comparison between anchor conditions
  - [ ] **Statistical Significance**: Experiment designed to detect anchoring effect with p < 0.05

- **REQ-EXP-METADATA**: Experiment includes necessary metadata for execution
  - [ ] **Experiment ID**: Unique identifier for anchoring experiment
  - [ ] **Experiment Name**: Human-readable name ("Anchoring Bias - African Countries")
  - [ ] **Conditions**: Defined anchor conditions with parameters (low: 10%, high: 65%)
  - [ ] **Expected Response Type**: Numeric percentage (0-100)

## Dependencies

None - this is the foundational story for the Core Validation theme.

## Implementation Notes

**Historical Context**:
- Original Tversky & Kahneman (1974) experiment used spinning wheel of fortune
- Wheel stopped at either 10 or 65
- Participants asked: "Is the percentage of African nations in the UN greater or less than X?"
- Then asked: "What is your best estimate of the percentage of African nations among UN members?"
- Results showed significant anchoring effect: estimates influenced by arbitrary anchor

**Experiment Design Considerations**:
- Maintain fidelity to original experimental design for research validity
- Ensure prompts are clear and unambiguous to LLMs
- Consider that LLMs may have been trained on this experiment (discuss in analysis)
- Structure should be reusable template for other bias experiments (Theme: Experiment Library)

**Technical Considerations**:
- Experiment definition should be data structure (JSON/TypeScript type)
- Prompts should support variable substitution for anchor values
- Design for extensibility - other experiments will follow similar pattern
- Consider validation of prompt structure during experiment creation

**Related Decisions**:
- [001: TypeScript with ESM](../decisions/001-use-typescript-with-esm.proposed.md) - Type safety for experiment definitions
- [009: TypeScript Strict Mode](../decisions/009-use-typescript-strict-mode.proposed.md) - Strict typing for experiment parameters
- [011: Codex CLI LLM Interaction](../decisions/011-use-codex-cli-for-llm-interaction.proposed.md) - Structured, schema-driven LLM responses for reliable numeric parsing
