While the prosecutor recommended 9 months, the defendant's repeated offenses suggest a need for a longer probationary period to impress upon her the seriousness of the crime and hopefully deter future offenses. However, since the penal code typically advises probation for this type of non-violent property crime, a custodial sentence does not seem appropriate or proportionate in this case.","timestamp":"2026-02-13T07:45:41.001Z"}
