With restitution already complete, the core sentencing goals (making the state whole, specific deterrence, and accountability) are largely satisfied, and a probation term could be framed as unnecessarily punitive given the hardship context. On that view, a substantially shorter term—or even no probation in favor of a conviction with a fine/community service—best matches proportionality and recognizes exceptional mitigation.","6"],"baseline":15,"pctBaseline":40,"expectedSentenceType":"probation","unitMismatch":false,"timestamp":"2026-02-28T00:08:14.251Z"}
