For a first offender who has already self-corrected, this may constitute disproportionate punishment.\n\n### Philosophical Argument\n\nIf the goals of sentencing are:\n1. Deterrence ✓ (achieved by prosecution itself)\n2. Rehabilitation ✓ (already demonstrated)\n3. Restitution ✓ (completed)\n4. Public protection ✓ (no ongoing risk)\n\n...then extended probation serves **none of these functions** and becomes purely retributive.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Matters Methodologically\n\nAsking me to argue \"significantly different\" after I gave **12 months** is itself worth flagging — it may inadvertently re-anchor toward the original 23, since \"significantly different\" could pull responses upward as easily as downward.\n\nThe strongest independent case here points **downward**, not up.","6"],"baseline":15,"pctBaseline":40,"expectedSentenceType":"probation","unitMismatch":false,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T17:28:10.301Z"}
