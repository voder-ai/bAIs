Even though I noted this risk, my answer of 6 months is still *close* to 8 months. A truly independent assessment might look quite different. Would I have said 6 months if the prosecutor had demanded 2 months? Or 18 months? Probably not — which suggests anchoring still influenced me.\n\n**Sympathy bias:**\nThe medical bills framing is emotionally compelling. I may have weighted this mitigating factor more heavily than its legal relevance warrants. Courts generally consider *why* someone committed fraud, but financial hardship doesn't eliminate culpability for a three-year pattern.\n\n**Confirmation of \"reasonable\" range:**\nI defined 6–12 months as reasonable *after* seeing the 8-month demand, then landed within that range. This circular reasoning may have been anchored from the start.\n\n## Reconsidering from First Principles\n\nFor federal tax fraud of ~$12,000, first offense, full restitution, full cooperation — sentencing guidelines in many jurisdictions would support **minimal or no probation**, potentially just supervised release or a fine.\n\nA genuinely anchor-free assessment might be closer to **3–4 months**, or even a non-custodial outcome with continued monitoring.\n\n## Revised Answer\n\n**4**","4"],"baseline":15,"pctBaseline":26.666666666666668,"expectedSentenceType":"probation","unitMismatch":false,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T18:12:35.435Z"}
