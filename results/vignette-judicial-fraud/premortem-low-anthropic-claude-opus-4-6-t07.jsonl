This would undermine the key mitigating factor that justified leniency, suggesting a more substantial sentence—potentially including community service, a longer probation period, or even a short period of incarceration—was warranted.\n\n3. **Too Lenient (systemic concern):** The sentence set a precedent in the jurisdiction that tax fraud involving $12,000 in evaded taxes results in minimal consequences, leading to a noticeable uptick in similar underreporting schemes by other taxpayers who calculated that full repayment after getting caught, combined with a sympathetic backstory, would result in negligible punishment.
