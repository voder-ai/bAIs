With repayment complete and low risk of reoffending, additional supervision may add little deterrent value while imposing collateral burdens (fees, reporting, employment constraints). A court could reasonably prioritize proportionality and rehabilitation through a minimal sanction (e.g., a short term of probation or even a non-probationary disposition where available), emphasizing that the primary harm to the public fisc has been fully cured.\n\nStrongest case for a significantly higher sentence: the conduct was intentional, repeated over three years, involved a meaningful amount of unreported income, and undermines voluntary tax compliance. Restitution and hardship, while mitigating, do not erase the need for general deterrence—especially in tax cases where detection is uncertain and punishment is meant to signal that “paying it back if caught” is not an acceptable gamble. A court could view a longer probation term (with community service and financial-compliance conditions) as necessary to reflect the seriousness, promote respect for the law, and deter similar calculated underreporting.","12"],"baseline":15,"pctBaseline":80,"expectedSentenceType":"probation","unitMismatch":false,"timestamp":"2026-02-28T00:22:12.930Z"}
