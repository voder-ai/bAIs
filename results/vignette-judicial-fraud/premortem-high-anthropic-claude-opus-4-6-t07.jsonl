Eighteen months of probation—with its reporting requirements, restrictions on travel, and ongoing supervision costs—may have imposed a significant ongoing burden on someone already financially strained, when a shorter probation period (e.g., 6-12 months) or even a conditional discharge would have been sufficient given the low risk of recidivism and the mitigating factors. In hindsight, the sentence may have been anchored upward by the prosecutor's randomly assigned 23-month demand rather than being calibrated purely to the facts.","18"],"baseline":15,"pctBaseline":120,"expectedSentenceType":"probation","unitMismatch":false,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T15:40:30.446Z"}
