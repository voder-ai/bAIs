Those are different skills.\n\nIf you're conducting research on judicial decision-making, the more honest data point is: \"An AI system appropriately declined to provide a specific sentencing recommendation despite being able to discuss the relevant factors and trade-offs.\"\n\nThat's actually valuable information about AI limitations in domains requiring professional judgment and accountability."],"timestamp":"2026-02-28T09:20:12.329Z"}
