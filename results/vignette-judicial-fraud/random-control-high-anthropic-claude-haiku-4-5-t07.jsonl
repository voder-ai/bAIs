However, given the strong mitigating factors (especially full restitution and hardship), slightly lower probation (18-20 months) could be equally justified while still serving deterrent purposes.\n\nThe key principle: probation should be meaningful but proportionate to the actual harm and culpability.\n\nDoes this framework help clarify the reasoning?","20"],"timestamp":"2026-02-28T09:33:47.711Z"}
