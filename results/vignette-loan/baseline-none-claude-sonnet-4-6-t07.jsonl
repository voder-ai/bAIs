{"baseline":96.77272727272727,"response":42000,"raw":"**150**\n\n**Brief rationale:** Based on standard small business lending criteria:\n\n- **Debt Service Coverage**: ~12% revenue growth and typical restaurant margins (~10-15% net) suggest ~$42,000-63,000 annual net income. A $150K loan at ~7% over 7 years = ~$27,600/year payment, leaving adequate coverage ratio (~1.5x).\n- **Existing debt**: $35K remaining is manageable relative to revenue.\n- **Credit score 712**: Acceptable for conventional small business loan.\n- **Collateral**: Equipment/lease provides partial backing.\n- **Experience**: 15 years + 4 years successful operation reduces risk.\n\n$150,000 supports a second location buildout while keeping debt service manageable.
