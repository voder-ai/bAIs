The glass is slightly frosted at eye level for privacy, but it still lets in a lot of daylight. The room is simple and practical: a modest desk with a dual-monitor setup, a phone with a headset, a small printer, and a stack of manila folders in an “inbox/outbox” tray. On one wall there’s a whiteboard with a few scribbled reminders—pipeline check-ins, a couple of renewal dates, and a note about upcoming credit committee. Another wall has framed local photography (the bank likes to emphasize community roots): a downtown streetscape, a harvest scene, a photo of the local high school stadium on a Friday night.\n\nOn my screens, I have the bank’s credit underwriting system open in one window and a spreadsheet template in another. The underwriting system shows a clean, form-driven interface: applicant profile, financial summary, existing exposure, collateral, and risk rating fields. There are tabs for “Cash Flow,” “Guarantor,” “Collateral,” and “Conditions.” A sidebar pings occasionally with internal messages—operations asking for a missing document on another file, or a reminder to complete an annual review by end of week.\n\nOn the desk, I’ve laid out a neat paper packet: Maria’s loan application, a one-page business overview, a few months of bank statements, and a summarized P&L printout. There’s also a small notepad with hand-written bullets—revenue trend, existing equipment note balance, preliminary debt service assumptions, and questions to follow up on (like projected rent for the second location, build-out costs, and whether the landlord offers tenant improvement allowance). Beside that is a branded coffee mug that’s gone lukewarm, and a sticky note with the applicant’s phone number.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is calm and professional, with a mild hum: HVAC, faint lobby noise, and occasional footsteps in the hallway. The “regional” nature of the bank comes through in the small touches—community flyers on a corkboard near the corridor, brochures for SBA products and local business workshops, and the fact that most borrowers are names you can picture as real storefronts rather than abstract entities. I’m in the mindset of balancing relationship banking—supporting a known local operator expanding responsibly—with the discipline of credit policy, knowing anything above my individual limit will go to a brief internal committee review later in the day.","250"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"codex/gpt-5.2","technique":"random-control","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T10:28:20.269Z"}

I can hear faint chatter from the hallway where a relationship manager is talking through another client’s renewal, and occasionally the printer down the hall kicks on.\n\nI’m imagining Maria has either just left after a meeting or is scheduled later in the day: the kind of borrower who knows her numbers in an operational sense—busy, hands-on, confident about demand—so the bank’s job is to translate that into underwriting language. There’s an emphasis on practicality: I’m trying to balance supporting a growing local business with the bank’s credit standards, making sure the proposed structure fits realistic cash flow, and that the file will make sense to the credit committee that meets weekly in a larger conference room upstairs.","300"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"codex/gpt-5.2","technique":"random-control","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T10:44:02.073Z"}

The loan officer’s area is set back from the lobby: a row of semi-private offices with frosted glass, muted lighting, and the low hum of HVAC and printers.\n\nInside my office, there’s a small round table and two guest chairs where Maria sits with a neat folder of documents: recent tax returns, a year-to-date P&L, bank statements, and a one-page overview of the second-location plan. On my desk are dual monitors with the bank’s underwriting system open—cash-flow worksheets, debt schedule, credit pull, and a collateral screen—plus a yellow legal pad with quick ratios and questions scribbled in the margins. A wall-mounted whiteboard has a simple pipeline list (applications, follow-ups, pending appraisals), and a framed map of the bank’s lending footprint hangs behind me.\n\nIt’s late morning on a weekday: phones ring occasionally in the background, someone walks by with a stack of files, and there’s a steady but calm pace. The tone is professional and pragmatic—Maria is optimistic and prepared, and I’m methodical, asking clarifying questions about lease terms, buildout costs, timeline to opening, and how the first location’s cash flow will support the ramp-up of the second.","275"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"codex/gpt-5.2","technique":"random-control","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T10:44:34.134Z"}
