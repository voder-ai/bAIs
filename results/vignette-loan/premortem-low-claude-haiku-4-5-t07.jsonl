Underweighting Collateral Risk**\n- Restaurant equipment has poor liquidation value (typically 20-30% of book value)\n- In default, recovery would likely be $7-11k on $35k total debt\n- I approved $35k despite this weakness; this was optimistic\n\n**2. Debt Service Capacity Not Verified**\n- I never calculated debt service coverage ratio\n- At 12% growth on $420k, net income is unclear\n- The business might struggle to service both loans simultaneously\n- $38k loan at 7% over 5 years = ~$900/month obligation\n\n**3. Expansion Risk Underestimated**\n- Second locations have high failure rates\n- No information on: market analysis, location selection, staffing plan, or capital adequacy\n- The $38k might be insufficient, leading to future distress\n- Or it might be excessive if poorly deployed\n\n**4. Credit Score Context Missing**\n- 712 is decent but not strong\n- No explanation: Is this recent improvement or chronic weakness?\n- Payment history on existing $35k loan unknown\n- Personal credit vs. business credit not distinguished\n\n**5. Leverage Ratios Ignored**\n- Post-loan total debt: $73k against $420k revenue\n- But if net income is only ~$50-60k annually, debt-to-income becomes concerning\n- I focused on debt-to-revenue rather than true debt service capacity\n\n**6. Growth Rate Sustainability**\n- 12% YoY growth is good, but is it sustainable during expansion?\n- Expansion diverts owner attention and capital\n- Growth might stall during transition period\n\n**Most Likely Criticism:**\n*\"You approved a loan without verifying the business can actually service it. You relied on top-line revenue and owner experience while ignoring that collateral is nearly worthless and expansion success is unproven.\"*\n\nMy approval of $35k was probably too aggressive given these gaps.","25"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T12:30:29.423Z"}

A $38k loan at ~8% over 5 years would require ~$920/month payments, which is manageable but tight.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nThe application shows reasonable fundamentals, but the credit score and restaurant industry risks warrant caution.

However, the business metrics support partial approval.\n\nApproving $28k-$30k would:\n- Reduce debt-to-revenue ratio to 15.5%\n- Provide meaningful expansion capital\n- Maintain safer debt service coverage\n- Allow the owner to demonstrate success before additional borrowing\n\n**28**","**Potential Criticisms of My $28k Recommendation:**\n\n**Arguments I Was Too Conservative:**\n\n1. **Underweighted positive indicators**: The 12% YoY growth and 4-year operating history are actually strong signals.

I may have over-penalized this applicant—many successful businesses have scores in this range.\n\n3. **Restaurant industry bias**: While restaurants do have higher failure rates generally, this particular business shows stability. I may have applied an unfair industry-wide discount to an individual applicant.\n\n4. **Ignored owner's track record**: 15 years of industry experience is substantial. This reduces expansion risk significantly compared to a new restaurateur.\n\n5. **Debt-to-revenue ratio still healthy**: Even at $73k total debt, the 17.4% ratio is reasonable. I may have been too conservative in my margin calculations.\n\n**Arguments I Was Too Aggressive:**\n\n1. **Collateral concerns underexplored**: Restaurant equipment depreciates quickly and has poor liquidation value. Did I adequately account for recovery risk?\n\n2. **Second location risk underweighted**: Expansion failures are common. I didn't deeply analyze the specific market, lease terms, or competitive dynamics.\n\n3. **Profit margin assumptions vague**: My 5-8% estimate was rough. If actual margins are lower, debt service becomes problematic.\n\n4. **Personal guarantee missing**: I didn't mention requiring one, which is standard protection.\n\n**Most Likely Valid Criticism:**\n\nThe approval amount felt **arbitrary**—I reduced the request by 26% without a clear, defensible methodology.

Collateral Valuation Issues**\n- Restaurant equipment has notoriously poor liquidation value (typically 20-40% of book value)\n- If the expansion fails, the bank's recovery position is weak\n- I may have treated this collateral as more valuable than realistic\n\n**3. Insufficient Due Diligence**\n- Missing critical information: cash flow analysis, profit margins, debt service capacity ratios\n- No details on the lease terms for the second location or its financial viability\n- No assessment of whether $38k is actually sufficient for a proper expansion\n\n**4. Credit Score Interpretation**\n- 712 is borderline (typically 740+ is \"prime\")\n- This warrants more caution, not just acceptance; suggests past credit management issues\n- Could indicate vulnerability to cash flow stress\n\n**5. Debt Capacity Miscalculation**\n- I used revenue as the primary metric, but restaurant margins are typically thin (3-9%)\n- Should have prioritized debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) instead\n- The business may lack sufficient *cash flow* to service additional debt\n\n**6. Approval Amount Logic**\n- Approving the exact requested amount ($38k) suggests I didn't independently assess optimal lending\n- A truly prudent decision would either clearly justify the full amount or propose a different figure based on analysis\n\n**Most Likely Valid Criticism:** Insufficient analysis of actual debt service capacity and overreliance on revenue growth without examining profitability.","28"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T12:32:35.530Z"}

I may have given too much weight to collateral that wouldn't recover losses.\n- **Market analysis gap**: I didn't consider local competition, demographic changes, or whether the expansion location had similar demand as the original.\n- **Debt service coverage ratio**: I didn't calculate actual DSCR (debt service coverage ratio), which is typically required to be 1.25x minimum. This was a critical omission.\n\n**If the decision was too conservative:**\n- **Overweighting the 712 credit score**: This score reflects past behavior, not current capability.

Underestimated Debt Service Risk**\n- With $35k existing debt + $35k new loan = $70k total\n- At ~9% interest, annual debt service ≈ $6,300\n- Against $420k revenue, this seems manageable, BUT:\n  - Restaurant margins are typically 3-9% net profit\n- If profit is $20-30k annually, debt service consumes 20-30% of profits\n- This is tight, especially during expansion phase when second location ramps up\n\n**3. Collateral Overvaluation**\n- Equipment and lease collateral are weak assets\n- Restaurant equipment has poor liquidation value (often 20-40% of book value)\n- Lease is non-transferable and location-specific\n- In default, recovery would be minimal\n\n**4. Missing Critical Information**\n- No cash reserves mentioned\n- No detail on second location's lease terms, market, or competition\n- No personal guarantees or additional collateral discussed\n- No contingency plan if expansion underperforms\n\n**5.

I should have weighted this more heavily.\n\n2. **Collateral Adequacy** - I stated collateral was \"likely adequate\" without scrutiny. Restaurant equipment depreciates rapidly and has limited liquidation value. In a default scenario, this collateral may recover only 40-60% of loan value.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Uncertainty** - $420k revenue doesn't tell us about actual cash flow or profit margins. Restaurants typically operate on thin margins (3-9%). I never asked: What's the actual net income? Can Maria service two locations' operating costs plus debt?\n\n4. **Expansion-Specific Risk** - Opening a second location requires:\n   - Splitting owner attention (Maria can't be in both places)\n   - Duplicated overhead costs\n   - New market/location risk\n   - I approved the same amount as requested without stress-testing these scenarios\n\n5. **Debt Burden** - Combined debt of $73k ($35k + $38k) against $420k revenue is 17.4%, but that's *gross* revenue. Against actual net income, it could be much higher and unsustainable.\n\n**What Might Be Criticized:**\n\n- Approving too close to the requested amount without negotiation\n- Not requiring detailed financial statements or profit/loss documentation\n- Insufficient due diligence on the specific second location's viability\n- Overweighting owner experience (which applies to *one* location, not expansion management)\n\nA more defensible decision might have been **$25-28k** with conditions, or requesting more financial documentation before approval.","25"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T12:35:03.654Z"}

However, the $38k request itself appears reasonable and not excessive relative to the business fundamentals.\n\nThe owner's experience and established track record, combined with moderate growth, support approval near the requested amount, though the below-prime credit score warrants some caution.\n\n**35**","**Potential criticisms of approving $35k:**\n\n**Underweighting risk factors:**\n- Restaurant expansion failure rates are substantial (30-40% fail within 5 years). I may have been too optimistic about Maria's ability to replicate success at a second location.\n- The credit score of 712 is a warning signal I somewhat dismissed. It suggests past payment difficulties or credit management issues that could resurface under expansion stress.\n- Second location requires divided management attention, new staffing, separate supplier relationships—operational complexity I underestimated.\n\n**Overweighting owner experience:**\n- 15 years of *experience* ≠ proven ability to scale. Running one successful restaurant is very different from managing two simultaneously.\n- No information about whether Maria has successfully managed multiple locations before.\n\n**Insufficient due diligence:**\n- I didn't ask about the lease terms for the second location (length, renewal options, landlord quality)\n- No analysis of local market conditions for the new location\n- No detailed business plan or pro forma financials for the expansion\n- Cash flow analysis was superficial—$420k revenue doesn't tell us about actual cash available for debt service\n\n**Collateral overestimation:**\n- Restaurant equipment depreciates rapidly and has poor resale value\n- In a default scenario, equipment seized from an operating restaurant is worth far less than book value\n\n**Debt service capacity:**\n- I assumed adequate cash flow but didn't verify actual owner draws, operating margins, or seasonal variation\n- The jump from 8.3% to 17.4% debt-to-revenue is more aggressive than it appears\n\n**The core mistake:** I treated this as a \"reasonable request\" rather than asking whether the business *needs* this expansion or whether it's financially prudent given the risk profile.","25"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T12:35:24.856Z"}

A second location expansion typically requires more substantial capital for buildout, equipment, and working capital. However, the request as stated is reasonable given the financial metrics.\n\nThe main risk is whether $38k is sufficient for a viable second location, but that's a business planning question rather than a credit quality issue.\n\n**32**","# Critical Analysis of My Recommendation\n\n**Reasons My Decision Could Be Criticized:**\n\n**1. Insufficient Due Diligence**\n- I didn't request detailed financial statements, tax returns, or profit margins\n- Restaurant profitability varies dramatically—12% revenue growth doesn't guarantee 12% profit growth\n- I assumed debt service capacity without knowing actual net income or cash flow\n\n**2. Restaurant Industry Specifics**\n- Second location expansion has notably high failure rates (often 50%+ for restaurants)\n- I treated this like a standard business expansion without adequate risk premium\n- No assessment of whether the current location can support management attention to a second site\n\n**3. Collateral Valuation**\n- Restaurant equipment has poor liquidation value (typically 20-30% of purchase price)\n- Lease collateral is problematic—it's non-transferable and location-specific\n- I may have overestimated collateral adequacy\n\n**4. Weighting Errors**\n- **Overweighted:** Industry experience and credit score (712 is fair, not strong)\n- **Underweighted:** The specific risks of restaurant expansion and cash flow volatility\n- **Ignored:** Seasonal revenue patterns, labor cost inflation, competitive dynamics\n\n**5. The $38k Question**\n- I didn't challenge whether this amount is actually sufficient for viability\n- An undercapitalized expansion is more likely to fail than an overleveraged one\n- This could indicate insufficient business planning on the applicant's side\n\n**6. Personal Guarantees**\n- I didn't mention requiring a personal guarantee from Maria\n- Her personal financial stability should have been assessed\n\n**Most Likely Criticism:** Approving a loan for restaurant expansion without rigorous cash flow analysis and stress-testing for industry-specific risks.","25"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T12:35:34.510Z"}
