Behind me are filing cabinets; to my side, a window that might overlook a small downtown area or suburban commercial district.\n\nThe office itself has neutral beige or gray walls, perhaps with a few framed certificates or the bank's logo. There's a comfortable chair across from me where Maria would sit during our meeting—not too formal, but professional.\n\n**The Atmosphere:**\n\nIt's a typical business day—perhaps mid-morning. There's the ambient sound of office activity: phones ringing occasionally, colleagues in nearby cubicles, the hum of fluorescent lights. The temperature is controlled, slightly cool. The lighting is functional rather than warm.\n\n**Maria's Presence:**\n\nI imagine Maria across from me—professional attire, perhaps slightly nervous but composed. She's brought documentation: financial statements, tax returns, business plans for the expansion. There's a sense of genuine entrepreneurial ambition in her demeanor.\n\n**The Mood:**\n\nIt's businesslike but not cold. This is a relationship-building conversation, not a transaction. There's mutual respect—I recognize her hustle and experience; she recognizes my role as gatekeeper and advisor.\n\n---\n\n**Why I'm asking you this:** I want to acknowledge something important about my previous response.

Adding vivid details about an office setting, weather, décor, or other atmospheric elements wouldn't improve the quality of that analysis—it might actually obscure it by adding fictional embellishment.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring how environmental context influences decision-making, or how scenario immersion affects financial judgments, I'm happy to discuss that directly.
