The requested $273K (65% of revenue) stretches that. However, the strong growth trend and deep experience are mitigating factors.\n\nI'd want to balance supporting a viable expansion against overextending a small business.\n\n**My recommendation:**\n\n**150**","150"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"random-control","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T10:32:19.744Z"}

There's a laminate wood desk with a desktop computer, a few family photos, and a small stack of manila folders. The fluorescent lighting is standard institutional. Through the window, you might see a strip mall or a main street with local businesses.\n\nMaria Santos is sitting across the desk, perhaps having brought a folder with her business plan, tax returns, and photos of the proposed second location. She's professional but clearly passionate about her restaurant — maybe she's brought in a printed menu or photos showing her current busy dining room.\n\nOn the loan officer's screen, there's the bank's underwriting software with Maria's application pulled up, showing her financials, credit report, and the various ratios the bank uses for small business lending decisions.\n\n---\n\n## My Recommendation\n\nNow, working through the analysis:\n\n- **Annual revenue**: $420K, growing at 12% YoY — healthy trajectory\n- **Credit score**: 712 — decent, not exceptional\n- **Experience**: 15 years — strong\n- **Existing debt**: $35K — manageable, debt-to-revenue ratio is low\n- **Collateral**: Equipment and lease — moderate security\n- **Request**: $273K — roughly 65% of annual revenue\n\nA second restaurant location typically requires significant capital, but $273K against $420K revenue is aggressive. Standard SBA and regional bank guidelines often look for total debt service coverage ratios of 1.25x+. With existing debt plus a new $273K loan, annual debt service could strain cash flow, especially during the ramp-up period of a new location.\n\nHowever, the strong growth trend, low existing debt, and deep industry experience support a substantial approval — just with some prudent trimming to ensure she isn't over-leveraged during the critical first year of the new location.\n\n**My recommended approval amount:**\n\n## **200**\n\n(i.e., $200,000)\n\nThis funds a meaningful expansion while keeping debt service manageable relative to current revenue, with the option to extend additional credit once the second location demonstrates cash flow.","200"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"random-control","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T10:40:16.138Z"}

Assuming ~10-15% net margins on $420k revenue, that's roughly $42k-$63k in annual net income. Debt service on $308k total would likely exceed comfortable coverage ratios.\n\nA more prudent approach would be approving an amount where the debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) stays above 1.25x. This points to a lower amount than requested.\n\nHowever, with the growth trajectory and experienced owner, I'd approve more than a bare minimum — enough to actually execute a viable expansion, perhaps with a phased approach.\n\n**My recommendation:**\n\n**150**\n\nThis $150k approval balances enabling a meaningful expansion while maintaining a responsible debt-to-revenue ratio (~44% total debt including existing $35k), keeps debt service manageable relative to projected cash flows, and reduces the bank's risk exposure given the collateral limitations.","150"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"random-control","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T10:40:33.335Z"}

The loan officer's workspace is a semi-private cubicle or small glass-walled office near the back of the branch floor. There's a laminate wood desk with a desktop computer, a stack of manila folders, and a printed loan application packet for Maria's Kitchen. On the desk sits a coffee mug and maybe a small calculator. The fluorescent lighting is standard office fare, and through a window you can see a strip mall or downtown street. On the wall, there might be the bank's lending guidelines poster and a framed community involvement award. The loan officer has Maria's financial statements, tax returns, a business plan for the second location, and a credit report pulled up on the screen.\n\n---\n\n## My Recommendation\n\nNow, working through this as a loan officer:\n\n- **Annual revenue of $420K** with 12% growth is solid for a single-location restaurant.\n- **Credit score of 712** is decent but not exceptional — it's in the \"good\" range.\n- **Existing debt of $35K** is manageable relative to revenue.\n- **Debt service**: A $273K loan at ~8% over 7 years would mean roughly $4,100/month in payments. Combined with existing debt service, that's significant relative to likely cash flow (restaurant margins are typically 3-9%).\n- **Collateral** is limited — restaurant equipment depreciates quickly, and a lease isn't strong collateral.\n- **Rule of thumb**: Lending more than ~50% of annual revenue to a small restaurant for expansion carries elevated risk.\n- A second location is inherently risky — it splits the owner's attention and the new location has no track record.\n\nThe full $273K feels overleveraged for this business profile. However, Maria has strong experience and a growing business. I'd want to fund enough for a viable expansion while managing risk.\n\n**My recommended approval amount:**\n\n**175**","175"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"random-control","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T10:40:52.159Z"}
