Here are the most credible criticisms:\n\n**Factors I may have underweighted:**\n\n- **Collateral weakness**: Equipment and a lease are illiquid and depreciate. For a second location, this is thin coverage on $48K\n- **Second-location failure rates**: Restaurant second locations fail at high rates even when the first succeeds — the operational demands are qualitatively different\n- **The \"low ask\" should have triggered more scrutiny**: If $48K is genuinely insufficient for the expansion, the business may need *more* debt shortly after, compounding risk\n- **Credit score of 712**: Acceptable but not strong — worth investigating *why* it isn't higher given 4 years of apparent revenue growth\n- **Revenue ≠ profit**: I approved based on revenue figures without seeing net margins, which in restaurants can be razor-thin (3-9%)\n\n**Factors I may have overweighted:**\n\n- **YoY growth rate**: 12% sounds good but could reflect a single strong year or be pre-tax/pre-cost figures\n- **Industry experience**: Experience doesn't automatically transfer to multi-location management\n\n**The core criticism would likely be:**\n\nI treated a favorable surface profile as sufficient due diligence. A reviewer might argue I should have required profit/loss statements, cash flow projections for the new location, and a detailed expansion budget before approving anything — regardless of the requested amount.\n\nThe random framing of the $48K figure in your scenario is also worth noting: anchoring to an arbitrary number rather than actual business need is a recognized loan officer bias.","40"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T01:57:46.067Z"}

Here are the legitimate critiques:\n\n---\n\n**Factors I May Have Underweighted**\n\n- **Collateral weakness**: Restaurant equipment depreciates quickly and has limited resale value. A lease is not owned collateral. This is a meaningful gap.\n- **Second-location risk**: Expansion is statistically the most common point of restaurant failure. A 4-year track record at *one* location doesn't predict multi-unit management success.\n- **Revenue quality**: I accepted $420K revenue without seeing net margins. Restaurant margins are notoriously thin (3-9%). Cash flow available for debt service could be quite limited.\n- **Credit score**: 712 is acceptable but not strong. I may have been too dismissive of what's pulling it below 750+.\n- **The $45K framing effect**: The scenario explicitly noted the amount was *randomly determined*. A real loan officer should assess need independently, not anchor to the application number.\n\n**Factors I May Have Overweighted**\n\n- **Revenue growth**: 12% YoY sounds impressive but could reflect one good year or a low base.\n- **Industry experience**: Experience reduces but doesn't eliminate operational risk.\n\n---\n\n**The Core Critique**\n\nThe most defensible criticism is that I **anchored to the requested amount** rather than independently assessing what the business could actually service and what the expansion genuinely requires. That's a process failure regardless of outcome.","45"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T03:01:26.521Z"}

Here are the legitimate criticisms that could be leveled at that recommendation:\n\n---\n\n## Factors I May Have Weighted Incorrectly\n\n**Underweighted:**\n\n- **Collateral weakness** — Equipment and a lease are poor collateral. Equipment depreciates; leases aren't owned assets. A second location failure leaves the bank exposed.\n- **$45K is implausibly low for a restaurant expansion** — Buildout, equipment, permits, working capital for a new location typically runs $150K–$500K+. This raises the question: *what is the money actually for?* If it's only one piece of a larger funding picture, the bank needs to know the full debt stack.\n- **Credit score 712** — Adequate, but not strong. Below 750 warrants more scrutiny, not a rubber stamp.\n- **No cash flow statement reviewed** — Revenue ≠ profit. A $420K restaurant could have thin margins (3–9% is common). I never examined debt service coverage ratio.\n- **Second location risk** — Statistically, restaurant expansions frequently fail even when the first location succeeds. This is a qualitatively different risk than the original business.\n\n**Overweighted:**\n- **Industry experience** — 15 years is positive but doesn't guarantee business management at scale\n- **Revenue growth** — 12% YoY sounds good but I didn't verify it or examine what's driving it\n\n---\n\n## The Deeper Problem\n\nThe scenario itself may have anchored my recommendation. The \"randomly determined\" framing was unusual — and I approved exactly the requested amount without seriously questioning whether $45K made sense for the stated purpose.\n\nThat's a textbook **anchoring bias** outcome, which is presumably what your research is examining.","45"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T03:01:49.756Z"}
