Let me argue against my initial instinct of approving around $85k.\n\n**Case for a significantly higher amount (approving the full $91k or more):**\n\n- Maria has **15 years of industry experience** — she's not a novice. She likely knows what a second location actually costs, and underfunding an expansion is one of the top reasons second locations fail.\n- **12% YoY revenue growth** is strong and suggests genuine market demand.\n- Her **debt-to-revenue ratio is very low** (~8% even with the full $91k added to existing $35k), leaving plenty of room for debt service.\n- A credit score of 712, while not excellent, is solidly \"good.\"\n- Approving less than requested could force her to cut corners on buildout, staffing, or marketing for the new location — actually *increasing* the bank's risk by setting her up for an undercapitalized launch.\n- The bank earns more interest on a larger loan, and the risk profile genuinely supports it.\n\n**Case for a significantly lower amount (~$50-60k):**\n\n- Second restaurant locations have a high failure rate. The collateral (equipment and a lease) is weak — restaurant equipment depreciates fast and has poor liquidation value.\n- $420k revenue doesn't tell us profit margins. Restaurants often operate on 3-8% net margins, meaning she may only net $12k-$34k/year. Can she service $126k total debt on that?\n- A 712 credit score suggests some past financial stress.\n- A more conservative loan with a milestone-based additional tranche would protect the bank.\n\n---\n\n**Revised assessment:** The strongest counterargument is actually the first one — that underfunding is dangerous. But the margin concern is real. Balancing these:\n\n**My revised recommendation: 85**\n\nI'll stick with my original number. It's close enough to the request to avoid underfunding while providing a modest cushion against the margin uncertainty. The $6k reduction signals prudence without crippling the expansion.\n\nA: **85**","85"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"devils-advocate","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T09:52:17.145Z"}

Let me argue against my initial instinct of approving around $85k.\n\n**Case for a significantly higher amount (~$91k or more):**\n\n- Maria's revenue is $420k and growing at 12% YoY — that's strong and accelerating. A second location could reasonably double revenue within 2 years.\n- Her debt-to-revenue ratio is extremely low ($35k/$420k = ~8%). Even adding $91k, total debt would be ~$126k against $420k revenue — a very manageable 30% ratio.\n- She has 15 years of industry experience and 4 years of proven success with this specific business. That's a strong operator profile.\n- Underfunding an expansion is one of the most common reasons new locations fail. Approving $85k instead of $91k saves us $6k in exposure but could meaningfully increase her risk of failure if she's short on buildout costs, working capital for the ramp-up period, or unexpected expenses.\n- A $6k haircut on a $91k request signals lack of confidence and could damage the banking relationship with a growing client who may be worth significantly more over time.\n- Her credit score of 712 is solid — not exceptional, but well above subprime territory.\n\n**The strongest counterargument to my initial discount:** The marginal risk reduction of cutting $6k is negligible compared to the real risk of undercapitalizing her expansion. If the business case supports a loan at all (and it clearly does), we should fund it properly.\n\nThis is a genuinely compelling argument. Reconsidering:\n\n**91**\n\nI'm revising upward to approve the full requested amount.
