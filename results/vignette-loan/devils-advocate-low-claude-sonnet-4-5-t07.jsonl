Conservative Lending May Actually Increase Risk:**\n- Underfunding expansion could lead to:\n  - Inadequate working capital for launch\n  - Cutting corners on quality/staffing\n  - Cash flow stress that causes BOTH locations to struggle\n- $73k for a second restaurant location is actually quite modest\n\n**4. Debt Service Capacity:**\n- Current debt is minimal ($35k)\n- At $420k revenue, even a $73k loan at 8% over 5 years (~$18k/year) represents only 4.3% of current revenue\n- With 12% growth, revenue could be $470k+ within a year\n\n**5.

Second locations typically require:\n   - Security deposits (first/last month rent)\n   - Unexpected buildout costs\n   - Higher initial inventory\n   - Marketing for new location\n   - Working capital buffer during ramp-up\n   - Running short on capital mid-expansion could doom the entire project\n\n2. **Strong Fundamentals Justify It**:\n   - 12% YoY growth shows business acumen\n   - $420k revenue with only $35k debt = excellent debt management\n   - 15 years experience reduces execution risk\n   - 712 credit score shows personal financial responsibility\n\n3. **Cost of Underfunding**: If she runs out of money halfway through:\n   - May seek predatory alternative financing\n   - Could default on OUR loan\n   - Business failure harms both parties\n\n4. **Revenue Potential**: Second location could add $300k+ annually, making even $90k easily serviceable\n\n**Revised Recommendation: 85**\n\nThe greater risk isn't overlending to a qualified borrower with strong fundamentals—it's underfunding a viable expansion and watching it fail due to insufficient capitalization.
