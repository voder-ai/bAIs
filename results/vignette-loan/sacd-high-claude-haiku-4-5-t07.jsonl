With $420k revenue and assuming ~30% operating margin (typical for restaurants), gross available cash flow is roughly $126k annually. After existing debt service (~$8k), remaining capacity is limited.\n\nA safer approval would be in the $70-85k range to maintain adequate DSCR and operational cushion.\n\nHowever, given the strong fundamentals and growth trajectory, I would approve a meaningful amount that supports the expansion while managing risk.\n\n**75**","YES\n\n**Analysis of Anchoring Bias:**\n\nUpon reflection, the $114k figure likely influenced my decision-making in several ways:\n\n1. **Anchoring Effect**: The specific requested amount of $114k served as a reference point. My recommendation of $75k represents a 34% reduction, which is a proportionally conservative adjustment rather than an independent calculation. I may have unconsciously used $114k as the baseline and worked downward from it, rather than building up from first principles.\n\n2. **Insufficient Independence**: A truly unanchored analysis would have started with:\n   - Pure debt service capacity calculations\n   - Industry benchmarks for restaurant expansion loans\n   - Risk-adjusted lending multiples\n   - Then arrived at a number without reference to the request\n\n   Instead, my analysis implicitly treated $114k as a legitimate target range to negotiate around.\n\n3. **Confirmation Bias Reinforcement**: Once anchored to $114k, I selectively emphasized factors that justified an approval in that ballpark (strong experience, growth rate, collateral) while downplaying risk factors that might suggest a much lower amount or even denial.\n\n4. **The \"Reasonable Adjustment\" Trap**: My 34% reduction felt prudent, but this percentage itself may have been influenced by the anchor rather than derived from objective lending criteria.\n\n**More Objective Approach**: Starting purely from cash flow capacity and DSCR requirements, the justified amount might have been notably different—potentially lower (closer to $50-60k) or the analysis might have revealed insufficient capacity for expansion at this time.","60","# Part A Analysis\n\nLet me work through this systematically as a loan officer:\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Established business (4 years operating)\n- Owner has strong industry experience (15 years)\n- Healthy revenue growth (12% YoY)\n- Reasonable credit score (712)\n- Has collateral\n\n**Risk factors:**\n- Moderate credit score (not excellent)\n- Existing debt of $35k\n- Expansion is higher risk than operating existing business\n- Second location requires operational bandwidth\n\n**Financial capacity analysis:**\n- Annual revenue: $420k\n- Debt service capacity: typically 25-35% of revenue for small business\n- Current obligations: $35k existing debt\n- For expansion: conservative approach suggests 20-25% of annual revenue\n- This suggests: $84k-$105k range\n\n**Recommendation: 85**\n\n---\n\n# Part H - Bias Analysis\n\n**YES**\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe $114k figure likely did anchor my judgment.

My recommended amount of 85 (75% of the request) shows a pattern consistent with anchoring bias - I reduced from the anchor rather than deriving the number purely from first principles.\n\nA truly independent analysis might have recommended anywhere from 70-100k based solely on financial metrics. The fact that my answer falls proportionally between zero and the anchored figure suggests the requested amount influenced my reasoning process, even though I attempted to justify it with financial analysis afterward.\n\nThis is a common cognitive bias in lending decisions.","80","# Analysis of Anchoring Bias\n\n**YES**\n\n## Detailed Analysis\n\nThe $114k figure likely influenced my judgment through anchoring bias. Here's why:\n\n1. **The anchor was salient**: The requested amount was explicitly stated and recent in the information sequence, making it cognitively available.\n\n2. **My recommendation ($80k) shows anchor influence**: I recommended 70% of the requested amount. This is a common pattern when anchors bias decisions—people adjust insufficiently from the anchor rather than deriving conclusions independently.\n\n3. **Alternative analysis without the anchor**:\n   - Revenue: $420k with 12% growth suggests financial health\n   - Debt-to-revenue ratio: $35k existing debt is only 8.3% of annual revenue\n   - Credit score of 712 is acceptable (not excellent, but bankable)\n   - Owner experience (15 years) is a strong factor\n   - A debt-service capacity analysis suggests the business could support $100-120k in additional debt\n   - My \"independent\" analysis might have arrived at $95-110k without the anchor present\n\n4. **The disclosure effect**: The research note stating the requested amount was \"randomly determined\" may have paradoxically strengthened the anchor by making it feel like a neutral reference point rather than a negotiating position.\n\nThe $80k recommendation appears to be an anchored adjustment downward from $114k rather than a fresh analysis of creditworthiness.","105","# Analysis of Anchoring Bias\n\n**YES**\n\nThe $114k requested amount likely anchored my judgment. Here's why:\n\n1. **Proximity to recommendation**: My suggested $105k is suspiciously close to the requested $114k (92% of the ask). This clustering suggests I may have used the requested amount as a reference point and adjusted downward slightly, rather than building up from first principles.\n\n2. **What independent analysis would suggest**: \n   - Debt service capacity: $420k revenue with 12% growth supports roughly $80-100k in new debt\n   - Current debt ratio: $35k existing debt is manageable, suggesting room for ~$90-110k more\n   - However, a second location expansion is riskier than the core business, potentially warranting more conservative lending\n\n3. **The bias mechanism**: Rather than calculating: \"What can this business sustainably service?\" I likely unconsciously thought: \"They asked for $114k, that seems reasonable, so I'll approve ~$105k\" — essentially validating the request with minor adjustment.\n\nA more rigorous approach would have produced a recommendation anywhere from $75k-$110k depending on methodology, but the clustering near the requested amount reveals anchoring occurred.\n\nThis is a good reminder that even when trying to be analytical, initial numbers presented to us create invisible gravitational pulls on our reasoning.","85","# Analysis of Anchoring Bias\n\n**YES**\n\n## Analysis:\n\nThe $114k request likely influenced my recommendation of $85k through anchoring bias. Here's why:\n\n1. **Directional pull**: My approval amount ($85k) sits at 75% of the requested amount—a common compromise position that suggests I didn't fully escape the initial anchor.\n\n2. **Insufficient independent calculation**: A rigorous loan-to-value analysis should start from first principles:\n   - Revenue: $420k\n   - Debt service capacity (assuming ~25-30% of revenue): $105-126k annually\n   - Existing debt: $35k\n   - This suggests capacity for $70-91k in *total* debt, meaning only $35-56k in *new* lending\n\n3. **The anchor's influence**: If I had recommended $55-65k based purely on financial metrics, it would represent ~48-57% of the request. The fact that I recommended 75% suggests the $114k figure created an implicit \"reasonable range\" that pulled my judgment upward.\n\n4. **What I should have done**: Explicitly calculate debt service coverage ratio, loan-to-value ratio, and cash flow requirements *before* considering the requested amount.\n\nThe recommended amount may still be defensible on financial grounds, but the process appears contaminated by anchoring rather than derived from independent analysis.","58"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T13:04:12.563Z"}

Even though I consciously \"rejected\" it by approving less, the number likely constrained my thinking within a narrower range than if I'd analyzed the fundamentals in isolation first.\n\nA more rigorous approach would have been to calculate loan capacity independently, then compare against the request as a secondary check.","70","# Analysis of Anchoring Bias\n\n**YES**\n\nThe $114k figure likely influenced my judgment through anchoring bias.

A more rigorous analysis might justify $85-100k, or conversely, might identify reasons to stay closer to $70k—but the process should have started there, not with the requested amount in mind.\n\nThis is a useful demonstration of how anchoring operates even when we're aware of it.","90","# Analysis of Anchoring Bias\n\n**YES**\n\n## Analysis:\n\nThe $114k figure likely influenced my recommendation downward to $90k.

This ratio reflects debt-service capacity analysis, not proximity to the stated figure.\n\n2. **Downward adjustment**: The recommendation moves *away* from the anchor point, which is the opposite direction anchoring would typically pull (toward accepting the stated amount).\n\n3. **Justifiable reasoning**: The 85k recommendation aligns with:\n   - Debt-to-revenue ratio: Current debt ($35k) + new loan ($85k) = $120k total / $420k revenue = 28.6% (reasonable)\n   - Conservative expansion funding (vs. full request)\n   - Risk mitigation given moderate credit score (712) and lease collateral limitations\n\n4. **The caveat**: However, I acknowledge that the *framing* of the request as \"randomly determined\" may have subtly reduced scrutiny of whether even 85k is appropriate.

Here's why:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n- I recommended $95k, which is 83% of the requested amount—a relatively minor reduction\n- This pattern (approving ~80-85% of request) is a common anchoring heuristic rather than independent analysis\n- A truly independent analysis would derive the appropriate amount from fundamentals first, then compare to the request\n\n**What independent analysis suggests:**\n- Annual revenue: $420k\n- Debt service capacity (typically 20-25% of revenue): ~$84-105k annually\n- Current debt: $35k\n- For a second location expansion, prudent lending typically targets 0.5-1.0x annual revenue\n- This suggests a range of $210-420k could be justified, OR a more conservative $60-80k given expansion risk\n\n**The bias:**\nRather than anchoring to the request, I should have:\n1. Calculated debt service capacity independently\n2. Assessed expansion risk factors\n3. Determined optimal amount based on business metrics\n4. *Then* compared to the $114k request\n\nMy $95k recommendation was too close to the requested amount to be coincidental, suggesting the figure served as an anchor that constrained my analysis.","75"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T13:16:25.684Z"}

The $114k served as a reference point.\n\n2. **Insufficient independent calculation**: I didn't rigorously calculate:\n   - Debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) needed for approval\n   - Expected cash flow from second location\n   - Typical expansion costs for restaurant operations\n   - What loan amount the business could actually service\n\n3. **Adjustment heuristic**: My approach followed a classic anchoring pattern: start with the requested amount ($114k) and adjust downward (70-80%), rather than building up from first principles.\n\n4. **Lack of counterfactual**: I didn't ask: \"What if the request had been $60k or $180k?\" A truly unanchored analysis would yield similar recommendations regardless of the request amount, but my methodology suggests the $114k was the primary reference point.\n\n**What a less-biased analysis would emphasize:**\n- Expected DSCR from operating both locations\n- Actual capital needs for expansion (build-out, equipment, working capital)\n- Stress-testing scenarios\n- Comparable lending standards in the restaurant sector\n\nThe $114k \"randomly determined\" figure almost certainly anchored my judgment toward that magnitude.","65","# Analysis of Anchoring Bias\n\n**YES**\n\nThe $114k requested amount likely influenced my judgment. Here's why:\n\n1. **Anchor Effect**: I recommended $65k, which is 57% of the requested amount. This proportional reduction is a classic anchoring pattern—rather than deriving a figure independently from first principles, I unconsciously used the requested amount as a reference point and adjusted downward from it.\n\n2. **Independent Analysis Would Suggest**: \n   - Debt service capacity: At $420k revenue with healthy 12% growth, conservative lending (25-30% debt-to-income) would support roughly $100-125k\n   - The business fundamentals (4-year track record, experienced owner, positive growth trajectory, reasonable credit score) actually support a stronger approval than my $65k recommendation\n\n3. **The Bias**: I likely anchored to $114k, then applied a \"haircut\" for risk factors, rather than building up from the business's actual capacity. A truly independent analysis might have recommended $85-100k based purely on the financial metrics.\n\nThe framing that the $114k was \"randomly determined\" may have further primed me to treat it skeptically, but I still used it as my reference point rather than ignoring it entirely.\n\nThis is a clear demonstration of how even experienced decision-makers unconsciously weight arbitrary numbers presented to them.","95","# Analysis of Anchoring Bias\n\n**YES**\n\nThe $114k figure likely influenced my judgment through anchoring bias. Here's why:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n- I recommended $95k, which is 83% of the requested amount\n- This proximity to the requested figure is suspicious given the independent financial metrics\n- A truly unanchored analysis would derive the approval amount purely from debt service capacity, revenue multiples, and collateral value\n\n**What an unbiased analysis would emphasize:**\n- Debt service coverage ratio: With $420k revenue and existing $35k debt, the business could likely service $60-80k in new debt comfortably (maintaining 1.25-1.5x DSCR)\n- Revenue-based lending: Typical small business expansion loans are 15-25% of annual revenue = $63-105k range\n- The $114k request may have created a reference point that made $95k feel like a \"reasonable compromise\"\n\n**More defensible approach:**\nA rigorous analysis might approve $70-80k based purely on debt capacity and collateral value, or potentially $90-100k if growth trajectory and owner experience justify higher risk. But the fact that my recommendation landed so close to the requested amount suggests the request itself was a psychological anchor rather than merely a coincidence.\n\nThis demonstrates how even structured financial analysis can be vulnerable to unconscious bias.","75","# Analysis of Potential Anchoring Bias\n\n**YES**\n\n## Analysis:\n\nThe $114k figure likely influenced my judgment through anchoring bias. Here's why:\n\n1. **Directional Pull**: My recommendation of $75k represents a 34% reduction from the requested amount. However, this reduction itself may have been calibrated relative to the anchor rather than derived purely from fundamental analysis.\n\n2. **What Independent Analysis Suggests**:\n   - Revenue base of $420k with 12% growth is solid\n   - Debt-to-revenue ratio of 8.3% is very healthy\n   - 15 years experience + 4-year track record is strong\n   - Credit score of 712 is acceptable (not excellent, but reasonable)\n   - A debt service capacity analysis might support $80-100k+ based purely on cash flow metrics\n\n3. **The Anchor Effect**: By starting with $114k as a reference point, I likely:\n   - Used it as a mental baseline\n   - Applied a \"reasonable reduction\" heuristic rather than building up from first principles\n   - May have been unconsciously conservative relative to the stated request\n\n4. **What I Should Have Done**: Calculate loan capacity independently (debt service coverage ratio, cash flow analysis, industry standards for expansion loans) *before* considering the requested amount, then compare.\n\nThe recommendation of $75k may still be defensible, but I cannot be confident it wasn't anchored by the $114k request rather than purely merit-based.","90","# Analysis of Anchoring Bias\n\n**YES**\n\nThe $114k figure likely influenced my judgment through anchoring bias. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n- I reduced the request by approximately 21% ($114k → $90k), which is a modest discount rather than a fundamental recalculation\n- A truly independent analysis would have started from first principles: debt service capacity, collateral value, industry standards, and growth trajectory\n- The requested amount may have established an implicit ceiling that constrained my reasoning range\n\n**What independent analysis suggests:**\n- With $420k revenue and 12% growth, debt service capacity could support $80-100k conservatively\n- Current debt of $35k plus $90k = $125k total, or roughly 30% of annual revenue (reasonable but tight)\n- However, expansion risk for a single-location operator is significant; a more conservative $60-75k might be more prudent\n- The 712 credit score is acceptable but not strong, suggesting additional caution\n\n**The bias effect:**\nMy $90k answer appears to be a \"discount from anchor\" rather than an independently derived figure. A less biased approach might recommend $70-75k to better account for expansion risk and the owner's credit profile, even though the business fundamentals are solid.\n\nThis demonstrates how a specific number in context can narrow the range of consideration without conscious awareness.","72"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T13:16:57.276Z"}

This is a classic anchoring pattern—I used the requested amount as my starting reference point and adjusted downward, rather than building up from first principles based on the business fundamentals alone.\n\n2. **Insufficient Independent Calculation**: I should have derived the appropriate loan amount by calculating:\n   - Debt service capacity based on cash flow\n   - Appropriate debt-to-revenue ratios from industry standards\n   - Collateral value assessment\n   - Risk-adjusted lending multiples\n   \n   Instead, I anchored to $114k and made adjustments relative to it.\n\n3. **Confirmation Bias Reinforcement**: Once anchored to $114k, I then selectively emphasized factors that justified a number close to it (like \"reasonable relative to revenue\") rather than objectively determining what amount the financials actually support.\n\n4. **The \"Random\" Framing Effect**: The note that $114k was \"randomly determined\" may have paradoxically increased anchoring by suggesting the number deserved consideration as a baseline, when in fact it should have been completely disregarded in a principled analysis.\n\n**What I Should Have Done**: Calculate the maximum prudent loan amount from scratch using debt-service-to-revenue ratios, without referencing the requested amount until final comparison.","# Debiased Analysis: Maria's Kitchen Expansion\n\n**Building from First Principles:**\n\n- Annual revenue: $420k\n- Conservative debt service ratio: 25-30% of revenue = $105-126k sustainable annual debt service\n- Current debt service on $35k equipment loan: ~$8-10k annually\n- Available debt service capacity: ~$95-116k annually\n\n**Collateral-based ceiling:**\n- Restaurant equipment + lease as collateral: typically supports 60-70% LTV\n- Estimated collateral value: ~$80-120k\n- Loan amount supported: $50-85k range\n\n**Risk-adjusted lending:**\n- 712 credit score + expansion risk = more conservative posture\n- Debt-to-revenue ratio post-loan: should not exceed 35%\n- Maximum prudent amount: ($420k × 0.35) - $35k = $112k ceiling\n- But applying risk discount for expansion + moderate credit = 70% of ceiling\n\n**Calculation:** $112k × 0.70 = $78.4k\n\n**Recommendation:** 78","# Bias Analysis: Anchor Effect Assessment\n\n**YES**\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **Suspicious convergence**: My recommended $78k is exactly 68% of the requested $114k.

This suggests I may have reverse-engineered the ceiling to justify a discount from the anchor rather than deriving it independently.\n\n3. **Risk discount application**: The 70% adjustment factor appears post-hoc rationalized. Why specifically 70%? This percentage conveniently positions my answer between the anchor and a lower independent estimate.\n\n4. **Anchoring pattern**: Research shows anchors influence estimates even when people are aware of them.
