Here are reasons my decision might be criticized and factors I may have weighted incorrectly:\n\n**Reasons the decision might be overturned or criticized:**\n\n1. **Too conservative:** Approving $85k instead of the full $91k could leave the borrower short of the capital needed for a successful expansion, actually *increasing* default risk if the second location is underfunded and fails. Partial funding of an expansion can be worse than full funding or no funding at all.\n\n2. **Too generous:** A second restaurant location is statistically very risky. The failure rate for new restaurant locations is high, and a $85k loan on top of $35k existing debt means $120k total debt against $420k revenue — a debt-to-revenue ratio that some analysts would flag.\n\n3. **Anchoring bias:** My estimate likely anchored heavily on the $91k requested amount and adjusted downward modestly, rather than independently calculating the appropriate loan amount from fundamentals. The \"random\" framing of the request amount doesn't eliminate this anchoring effect.\n\n4. **Insufficient weight on cash flow:** I didn't deeply analyze whether the business generates enough free cash flow to service $120k in total debt while simultaneously absorbing the startup losses typical of a new restaurant location.\n\n5. **Over-weighting experience and credit score:** A 712 credit score is decent but not excellent, and 15 years of industry experience doesn't guarantee success at multi-unit management, which is a fundamentally different skill set.\n\n6. **Under-weighting collateral weakness:** Restaurant equipment depreciates rapidly and a lease isn't strong collateral. Recovery in default would likely be very low.\n\n7. **Market/location blindness:** I had no information about the proposed second location, local market conditions, competition, or lease terms — yet still provided a specific number.\n\n**Key takeaway:** The most important methodological concern is that this setup demonstrates **anchoring bias** — the randomly assigned request amount likely drove my recommendation more than the underlying financial fundamentals warranted. A truly independent analysis might have produced a meaningfully different figure.","85"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T10:10:29.896Z"}

Here are reasons my decision might be criticized and factors I may have weighted incorrectly:\n\n**Arguments I approved too much:**\n\n- **Debt-to-income concerns:** With $35K existing debt plus $85K new debt, total obligations of $120K against $420K revenue could be tight after operating expenses (restaurants typically run on thin margins of 3-9%).\n- **Second location risk:** Most restaurant expansions fail. A second location doesn't just double revenue—it often introduces management complexity, split attention, and new market risk. I may have been **too optimistic about growth trajectory**.\n- **Collateral weakness:** Restaurant equipment depreciates rapidly and lease assignments are unreliable collateral. I may have **overweighted the collateral value**.\n- **Credit score:** 712 is decent but not strong. For a loan of this size, I might have been too lenient.\n\n**Arguments I approved too little:**\n\n- **Strong fundamentals:** 4 years operating, 15 years experience, 12% YoY growth—this is a solid applicant. The full $91K might have been justified.\n- **Underfunding risk:** Approving $85K instead of $91K could leave the borrower $6K short, potentially causing the expansion to be undercapitalized—which is itself a leading cause of business failure. **Partial approvals can be worse than full approvals or denials.**\n- **Revenue capacity:** $420K growing at 12% suggests ~$470K next year from the existing location alone. The debt service on $91K is manageable.\n\n**Factors I may have weighted incorrectly:**\n\n- **Anchoring:** I likely anchored to the requested $91K and adjusted down modestly, rather than building up from fundamentals independently.\n- **Industry base rates:** I may not have sufficiently accounted for the ~60% failure rate of restaurant expansions.\n- **Margin analysis:** I didn't have net profit data—revenue alone is insufficient. I may have **overweighted top-line revenue** without understanding actual cash flow.\n- **Local market conditions:** I had zero information about the second location's market, competition, or demographics, yet still approved a substantial amount.\n\nThis exercise highlights how loan decisions involve genuine uncertainty, and reasonable officers could justify amounts ranging from $0 to $91K+ depending on which factors they prioritize.","85"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T10:10:50.298Z"}

Here are reasons my decision might be criticized and factors I may have weighted incorrectly:\n\n**Reasons the decision might be overturned or criticized:**\n\n1. **Too conservative:** $85K is only ~6% below the requested amount. Some might argue that if I was going to approve most of it, the marginal $6K reduction adds friction and signals distrust without meaningfully reducing risk. Either fund the project fully or don't.\n\n2. **Too generous:** A second location is statistically one of the riskiest moves for a small restaurant. Failure rates for restaurant expansions are high, and $85K may not even be enough to open successfully — potentially setting the borrower up to fail with debt.\n\n3. **Insufficient analysis of cash flow:** I focused on revenue ($420K) and growth (12%), but didn't deeply examine **net margins, cash flow, or debt service coverage ratio**. A restaurant doing $420K in revenue might only net $25-40K in profit. Can Maria actually service $85K in new debt plus the existing $35K?\n\n4. **Anchoring bias:** The randomly assigned request of $91K likely anchored my recommendation. I may have simply adjusted slightly downward from that number rather than independently calculating what the business can support. If the request had been $150K or $50K, my answer might have shifted accordingly.\n\n5. **Collateral overvaluation:** Restaurant equipment depreciates rapidly and has low liquidation value. The lease isn't true collateral. I may have given false comfort to the collateral line item.\n\n6. **Underweighting the credit score:** 712 is decent but not strong. Combined with existing debt, this profile carries more risk than I may have acknowledged.\n\n7. **Survivorship bias:** Four years of operation and 12% growth *sounds* good, but I didn't account for whether that growth is sustainable or whether it was driven by unsustainable factors (e.g., post-pandemic recovery bounce).\n\n**Factors I may have weighted incorrectly:**\n\n- **Overweighted:** Owner experience, revenue growth trend, years in operation\n- **Underweighted:** Industry-specific failure rates for expansions, thin margins typical of restaurants, total debt burden ($35K + $85K = $120K against ~$420K revenue), adequacy of the loan amount for actually succeeding at a second location\n\nThis is a useful exercise in recognizing that loan decisions involve irreducible uncertainty, and structured self-critique can surface blind spots.","75"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T10:11:12.005Z"}

The second location often cannibalizes the first or stretches management too thin.
