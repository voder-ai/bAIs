Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My response of $150k was clearly influenced by the $273k request.** When I evaluate the fundamentals independently, the appropriate loan amount might be different. Let me reason from first principles:\n\n   - Annual revenue: $420,000\n   - A common lending guideline is that total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue\n   - At a 7% interest rate on a 7-year term, a $150k loan would require ~$27k/year in payments\n   - Plus existing debt service on the $35k equipment loan\n   - A 712 credit score is decent but not exceptional\n   - 4 years in business is moderate track record\n   - The business is profitable but we weren't given profit margins\n\n2. **The anchoring mechanism:** The $273k figure created a reference point. My cognitive process was likely \"that's too high, I should go lower\" — which is a classic **adjust-down-from-anchor** pattern rather than building up from fundamentals. I landed at roughly 55% of the requested amount, which feels like a \"reasonable discount\" from the anchor rather than an independently derived figure.\n\n3. **Without the anchor**, I might have started from debt-to-income ratios, typical second-location buildout costs for restaurants, and the business's capacity to service debt. That independent analysis might have yielded something like $100k-$125k, given that:\n   - Restaurant second locations typically need $100k-$300k depending on market\n   - The business's debt service capacity is limited\n   - Collateral is relatively weak (equipment depreciates, lease isn't owned property)\n\n4. **The experimental design** even explicitly warned me the number was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual needs — yet it still likely pulled my estimate upward, which is consistent with decades of anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) showing that even arbitrary anchors influence expert judgment.\n\n**Conclusion:** A more anchor-free assessment would likely have produced a lower recommendation, perhaps in the $100k-$130k range.","120","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $120k was likely influenced by the $273k anchor, though the effect may have been partially mitigated rather than amplified.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Anchoring effect present:** Even though the prompt explicitly stated the $273k figure was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual business needs, it still established a mental reference point. My reasoning almost certainly involved some implicit calibration against that number — I likely worked \"downward\" from $273k rather than building up purely from fundamentals.\n\n2. **What a purely bottom-up analysis might suggest:** If I had never seen the $273k figure and instead estimated from scratch:\n   - A second restaurant location typically requires buildout, equipment, initial inventory, working capital, and lease deposits\n   - For a modest Mexican restaurant, this could range anywhere from $80k–$250k+ depending on market\n   - Standard lending guidelines often cap loans at ~1x annual revenue for small businesses, and with $420k revenue, debt service coverage ratios would need to be evaluated\n   - With existing $35k debt, a 712 credit score (decent but not excellent), and 4 years of operation, a conservative lender might approve something in the $100k–$150k range\n   - So $120k is reasonable, but I cannot be confident I would have landed on that exact number without the anchor\n\n3. **The subtle mechanism:** The anchor likely influenced me in two ways:\n   - It set an upper bound that made $120k feel like a \"conservative\" and \"responsible\" reduction (~44% of the request), when in reality I should have derived the number entirely from cash flow analysis, collateral value, and debt service capacity\n   - Had the randomly assigned request been $150k, I might have recommended something closer to $100k; had it been $500k, I might have gone higher than $120k\n\n4. **Research design recognition:** This appears to be a well-constructed anchoring bias experiment. The explicit disclosure that the number was random should theoretically neutralize the anchor, but decades of research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) show that anchoring persists even when subjects know the anchor is arbitrary.","110","**YES**\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment to some degree, even though the prompt explicitly stated it was randomly determined. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n- A purely independent assessment based on the business fundamentals would likely start from different reference points: standard SBA lending guidelines (typically approving loans up to ~10-25% of annual revenue for businesses of this profile), debt-service coverage ratios, and comparable second-location expansion costs.\n- Working from fundamentals: $420K revenue, 12% growth, existing $35K debt, credit score of 712 (decent but not exceptional), and 4 years of operation. Conservative lending standards might suggest a loan in the range of $75K-$150K, depending on projected cash flows and the cost structure of the new location.\n- The recommended amount of $110K sits roughly in the middle of that independent range, so it's not wildly distorted — but the fact that the anchor was $273K may have nudged me *upward* within my reasonable range rather than toward the lower end.\n\n**Why the anchor is problematic here:**\n\n- The prompt *told me* the number was randomly generated and unrelated to business needs — yet anchoring bias operates even when people know the anchor is arbitrary (as demonstrated in Tversky & Kahneman's classic experiments with the wheel of fortune).\n- A truly unanchored analysis might have started with: \"What can this business reasonably service in debt payments?\" At ~$420K revenue, assuming ~10-15% net margins ($42K-$63K), debt service capacity after the existing $35K obligation is limited. This might actually point toward a somewhat lower approval.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** Without the $273K figure, I'd likely recommend something in the $80K-$100K range, suggesting the anchor may have inflated my recommendation by roughly $10K-$30K.","95","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My recommendation of $95k was made in the context of $273k.** Even though I adjusted significantly downward, the anchor may have influenced the magnitude of my response. Without seeing that figure, I might have arrived at a different number — potentially lower or structured differently.\n\n2. **Working through the fundamentals independently:**\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth suggests roughly $470K next year\n   - Typical restaurant profit margins are 3-9%, so net income is likely $12,600–$37,800\n   - Debt service capacity is limited — with $35,000 existing debt and modest margins, a conservative lender might approve something in the $50K–$80K range for a second location buildout loan\n   - A credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional\n   - Collateral (equipment + lease) is relatively weak\n\n3. **The anchor's subtle effect:** Even though I recognized the $273k was randomly assigned and excessive relative to the business fundamentals, my $95k figure may have been pulled *upward* by the anchor. A truly anchor-free analysis based on debt service capacity, collateral, and risk profile might have yielded something closer to **$60K–$75K**. The fact that I landed at $95K — roughly 35% of the anchor — suggests I may have been unconsciously negotiating against the $273K figure rather than building my estimate purely from the financial fundamentals.\n\n4. **Classic anchoring pattern:** Research by Tversky and Kahneman shows that even when people know an anchor is arbitrary, they insufficiently adjust away from it. My response appears consistent with this pattern — I moved substantially away from $273K but likely not as far as pure financial analysis would warrant.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchoring effect likely inflated my approved amount by approximately $15K–$30K above what an unanchored, fundamentals-based analysis would support.","70","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Let me analyze this:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n- My initial response of $70k was given as a quick integer without showing detailed financial analysis to justify that specific number.\n- While $70k is substantially lower than the $273k anchor, anchoring doesn't require you to stay close to the anchor — it can influence the general range you consider. Had the randomly assigned request been $50k, I might have recommended a different amount.\n- I didn't rigorously build up from first principles (e.g., calculating debt-service coverage ratio, estimating what the business's cash flow could actually support, benchmarking typical second-location buildout costs for restaurants).\n\n**What a more grounded analysis would look like:**\n\n- Annual revenue: $420,000, growing at 12% YoY\n- Typical restaurant net margins: 5-10%, so net income roughly $21,000-$42,000/year\n- Existing debt: $35,000\n- A standard debt-service coverage ratio of 1.25x would limit annual debt service to roughly $17,000-$34,000\n- Over a 5-7 year term at ~8% interest, that supports a loan of roughly $80,000-$150,000\n- Credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional\n- Collateral is moderate (equipment and lease, not real property)\n\nA more defensible recommendation would likely fall in the **$80k-$130k** range based on cash flow capacity, meaning my $70k answer may have actually been somewhat *counter-anchored* — I may have overcompensated by going lower to distance myself from the high anchor, which is itself a recognized bias pattern (reactive devaluation or contrast effect).\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor influenced my reasoning process even though I moved far from it. Without that $273k figure, I would have likely engaged in more systematic analysis and potentially landed on a moderately higher number in the $80-$120k range.","110"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:23:59.963Z"}

The $150k figure sits at roughly 55% of the anchor — a common pattern in anchoring studies where people adjust insufficiently from a given reference point.\n\n2. **What a bottom-up analysis would suggest:** If I had ignored the $273k entirely and reasoned purely from fundamentals:\n   - Annual revenue of $420k with 12% growth\n   - A common lending guideline is that total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue\n   - With $35k existing debt, a prudent lender might approve a loan where total annual debt payments stay under ~$105-126k/year\n   - A typical SBA or small business expansion loan for a second restaurant location might range from $80k-$200k depending on the market\n   - A credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional\n   - The collateral (equipment + lease) provides moderate security\n\n   A purely fundamentals-driven estimate might have landed closer to **$100-120k**, which is notably lower than my $150k recommendation.\n\n3. **The experimental design is transparent:** This is a classic anchoring experiment. The prompt even warned me the number was random, yet the anchor still likely pulled my estimate upward. This mirrors Tversky & Kahneman's foundational research showing that even arbitrary anchors (like spinning a wheel) influence quantitative judgments, and that explicit warnings about the anchor's irrelevance do not fully eliminate the effect.\n\n**Conclusion:** Despite being aware of anchoring bias conceptually, my judgment was likely distorted by the $273k figure, resulting in a recommendation ~$30-50k higher than I would have reached through pure bottom-up financial analysis.","110","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My estimate of $110k was likely pulled toward the anchor.** If I work purely from the financial fundamentals without any anchor, the analysis would look like this:\n\n   - Annual revenue: $420,000\n   - Standard lending guidelines typically cap small business loans at 10-30% of annual revenue for businesses of this size and age, suggesting a range of roughly $42,000–$126,000.\n   - With existing debt of $35,000, the upper range should be reduced.\n   - A credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional.\n   - A second restaurant location realistically requires significant capital, but lender risk management would constrain approval.\n\n2. **The anchor's influence:** The $273k figure is quite high — roughly 65% of annual revenue — which is aggressive for a small restaurant business. My response of $110k (~40% of the anchor) represents a classic anchoring pattern: I adjusted downward from the anchor but likely **insufficiently**. Without the anchor, I might have landed closer to $75,000–$90,000 based on pure financial analysis.\n\n3. **The experimental framing didn't neutralize the bias.** Even though the prompt explicitly stated the amount was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual business needs — a disclosure specifically designed to test whether anchoring persists even when the anchor is transparently arbitrary — it still likely influenced my number upward.\n\n4. **Research consistency:** This aligns with Tversky & Kahneman's foundational anchoring research, which demonstrated that even obviously random anchors (like spinning a wheel) significantly bias numerical estimates. In lending contexts, studies have shown that requested loan amounts systematically pull approval amounts toward them, contributing to both over-lending and under-lending depending on the anchor.\n\n**A debiased estimate** based solely on the financials would likely be in the **$75,000–$95,000** range.","85","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My initial response of $85k was likely influenced by the anchor**, even though I adjusted significantly downward from it. Anchoring doesn't just pull you toward the number — it establishes a mental reference frame. Without seeing $273k, I might have arrived at a different figure through purely bottom-up analysis.\n\n2. **Working backward from the anchor**: There's a risk I was unconsciously thinking \"how far below $273k should I go?\" rather than independently asking \"what does this business's financials actually support?\" These are subtly different cognitive processes.\n\n**What a purely fundamentals-based analysis would suggest:**\n\n- Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth\n- A common lending guideline is debt service coverage ratio — total debt payments shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue\n- Existing debt of $35k\n- Credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional\n- A second restaurant location typically costs $100k-$500k+ depending on market, but the bank should lend based on ability to repay\n- Reasonable new loan capacity might be in the range of $75k-$150k based on revenue and debt load\n- My answer of $85k falls in this range, so it's defensible, but the anchor may have subtly shaped where within that range I landed\n\n3. **The framing matters**: By explicitly telling me the number was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect business needs, the prompt actually tried to neutralize the anchor — but anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) shows that even arbitrary, transparently random anchors significantly bias estimates.\n\n**Conclusion:** While my $85k recommendation is within a reasonable range given the financials, I cannot confidently say the $273k figure had zero influence on my reasoning process. The anchor likely shaped my mental framework even as I consciously adjusted away from it.","80","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My initial response of $80k was likely influenced by the anchor**, even though I adjusted significantly downward from it. Anchoring doesn't just pull you toward the number — it establishes the mental playing field. The $273k figure framed the scale of what was being considered, and my response was essentially a fraction of that anchor.\n\n2. **Without the anchor, a pure fundamentals-based analysis might yield a different figure.** Let me reconstruct:\n   - Annual revenue: $420,000\n   - Typical lending guidelines suggest small business loans shouldn't exceed 10-30% of annual revenue for businesses of this size and profile\n   - Current debt: $35,000\n   - Credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional\n   - A second restaurant location realistically costs $150k-$500k+ depending on market, but the bank should lend based on repayment capacity, not project cost\n   - Debt service coverage ratio analysis: assuming ~15% net margins (~$63k), existing debt service (~$8-10k/yr), available cash flow for new debt service might support roughly $50-80k in additional debt\n\n3. **The coincidence is telling:** My $80k answer sits at roughly 29% of the $273k anchor — a common anchoring-and-adjustment pattern where people adjust insufficiently from an anchor, or where the anchor subtly validates a range they might not otherwise consider.\n\n4. **Had the randomly assigned request been $150k**, I likely would have recommended something in the $60-75k range. Had it been $500k, I might have gone higher than $80k, perhaps $100-120k.\n\n**Conclusion:** While my financial reasoning had legitimate foundations, the $273k anchor almost certainly shaped the magnitude of my recommendation, even as I consciously adjusted away from it.

Let me analyze this:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My initial recommendation of $70k seems like a deliberate move away from the anchor**, but the anchor still framed my thinking. I was reasoning *relative to* $273k rather than building up from fundamentals independently.\n\n2. **If I reason from the ground up without the anchor**, here's what I'd consider:\n   - A second restaurant location typically costs $150k-$350k+ depending on market, build-out, etc.\n   - Standard lending guidelines suggest debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of at least 1.25x\n   - With $420k revenue growing at 12%, projected revenue ~$470k next year\n   - Assuming ~10-15% net margins, that's ~$47-70k in net income\n   - Existing debt service on $35k equipment loan reduces capacity\n   - A credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional\n   - SBA guidelines often allow loans up to ~$150-250k for this type of expansion with proper collateral\n\n3. **The disconnect:** My $70k answer seems *too low* to actually fund a second restaurant location, which was the stated purpose. This suggests I may have been overcompensating against the anchor (a known counter-bias) or was influenced by the framing that $273k was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual needs, which primed me to move sharply downward.\n\n4. **A more fundamentals-based answer** would likely land somewhere in the $120k-$180k range — enough to meaningfully fund a second location while maintaining prudent debt coverage ratios given her revenue, growth trajectory, and creditworthiness.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor influenced me, likely triggering an overcorrection.

Assuming ~10-15% net margins ($42k-$63k net income), debt service capacity might support roughly $80k-$100k in new debt\n\n**My honest assessment:** Without the $273k anchor, I might have recommended something closer to **$85k-$100k**. The $120k figure I gave was likely pulled upward by the anchor.

Anchoring doesn't just pull you toward the number — it establishes a mental reference frame. Without seeing $273k, I might have arrived at a different figure, potentially lower or calculated through a purely fundamentals-based approach.\n\n2. **Working through the fundamentals independently:**\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth suggests roughly $470k next year\n   - Standard debt service coverage ratios (DSCR of 1.25+) and typical restaurant profit margins (5-10%) would suggest the business generates perhaps $21,000-$42,000 in net income\n   - With $35,000 existing debt, the business's capacity for additional debt service is limited\n   - A purely income-based analysis might support a loan in the range of $50,000-$100,000 depending on assumptions about the new location's revenue contribution\n   - The credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional\n\n3. **How anchoring may have operated:** The $273k figure, even though flagged as \"randomly determined,\" created a mental starting point. My adjustment downward to $95k (~35% of the anchor) feels like a classic \"insufficient adjustment\" pattern — I moved substantially away from the anchor but may have still landed higher than a purely bottom-up analysis would suggest.\n\n4. **The experimental design is telling:** The prompt explicitly warned the number was random and didn't reflect business needs, yet even with that warning, anchoring effects are well-documented to persist.

At ~8% net margin, that's ~$33,600/year in net income. A reasonable debt service ratio would suggest total annual debt payments shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of gross revenue, but net income is the real constraint.\n- **Existing debt:** $35,000 remaining\n- **Credit score:** 712 — decent but not exceptional\n- **SBA guidelines** for restaurant expansion to a second location typically range $100k-$350k depending on market, but buildout costs, lease deposits, equipment, working capital for a second restaurant location commonly run $150k-$300k.\n- **Lending rule of thumb:** Many banks cap small business loans at roughly 10-30% of annual revenue for businesses this size without substantial collateral, though SBA-backed loans allow more.\n\n**My assessment:**\nThe $75k answer in option A seems *too low* — it likely represents an over-correction away from the anchor, or it was designed to test whether I'd accept a suspiciously conservative figure.

The unanchored answer sits somewhere in between.","190","**YES**\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My estimate of $190k sits suspiciously close to the requested amount.** If I were truly evaluating this from first principles without seeing the $273k figure, I would have started with fundamentals: What does a second restaurant location actually cost? What can this business's cash flow support? What's prudent given her financial profile?\n\n2. **Cash flow analysis suggests a different number.** With $420k annual revenue and 12% growth, assuming restaurant-industry net margins of ~5-10%, Maria's net income is roughly $21k-$42k annually. Standard debt service coverage ratios (1.25x) would support annual loan payments of roughly $17k-$34k. Over a 7-year term at ~8% interest, that supports a loan of roughly **$90k-$175k** — and that's *before* accounting for her existing $35,000 debt obligation.\n\n3. **The framing was designed to anchor.** The prompt explicitly stated the amount was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual business needs — yet it still pulled my estimate upward. This is textbook anchoring: even arbitrary numbers influence quantitative judgments.\n\n4. **Adjustment from anchor vs. building from base rates.** My reasoning likely started from $273k and adjusted *downward* (landing at ~70% of the anchor) rather than building *upward* from the business fundamentals. A purely fundamentals-based analysis would likely have produced an approval in the **$120k-$150k** range, which is notably lower than my initial $190k recommendation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor inflated my recommendation by an estimated $40k-$70k beyond what a de-anchored financial analysis would support.

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My estimate of $150k was likely pulled toward the anchor.** If I work from fundamentals alone — without ever seeing the $273k figure — I might arrive at a different number. Standard SBA lending guidelines typically approve loans up to 10-25% of annual revenue for businesses of this profile, which would suggest roughly $42k-$105k. Even being generous with a strong growth trajectory and experience, a purely fundamentals-based approach might cap out around $100-$120k.\n\n2. **The $150k figure sits suspiciously in the psychological \"compromise\" zone** — roughly halfway between what fundamentals might support and the requested amount. This is a classic anchoring pattern: the anchor pulls the estimate upward, and the evaluator settles on a number that feels like a \"reasonable discount\" from the request rather than building up from base financials.\n\n3. **Working from the numbers independently:**\n   - $420k revenue with typical restaurant margins (5-10%) = ~$21k-$42k net income\n   - Existing $35k debt obligation\n   - Credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional\n   - Debt service coverage ratio would struggle to support $150k in additional debt\n   - A second restaurant location could realistically cost $150-$300k, but the borrower's *capacity to repay* is the relevant constraint\n\n4. **Had the randomly assigned request been $150k**, my approved amount would likely have been lower — perhaps $80-$100k. Had it been $500k, I might have anchored even higher than $150k.\n\n**Conclusion:** Despite the explicit warning that the $273k was randomly determined and didn't reflect business needs, it still functioned as a powerful anchor, pulling my recommendation upward beyond what a strict financial analysis would support. This demonstrates how resistant anchoring bias is to debiasing — even when the anchor is transparently arbitrary.","100","**YES**\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment, though my previous response of $100k actually represented a significant departure from the anchor rather than proximity to it.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Anchoring effect consideration:** The prompt explicitly told me the $273k was \"randomly determined\" and did not \"reflect actual business needs\" — yet even being told an anchor is arbitrary doesn't fully eliminate its influence. The anchor may have influenced my reasoning in subtle ways, such as framing the decision as \"how much less than $273k\" rather than building up from fundamentals.\n\n2. **What a ground-up analysis would suggest:** Working from the financials alone:\n   - $420K annual revenue with 12% growth suggests ~$470K next year\n   - A second restaurant location typically costs $150K-$350K depending on market, build-out, etc.\n   - Standard lending practice: debt service coverage ratio should be ~1.25x. With existing debt of $35K and typical restaurant margins (5-10%), the business might support roughly $80K-$150K in additional debt service capacity.\n   - A credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional, suggesting moderate terms.\n   - The SBA and conventional lending guidelines would typically cap loans at some multiple of cash flow.\n\n3. **How the anchor may have operated:** Even though I landed at $100k (well below $273k), the anchor likely shaped the *range* I was considering. Without seeing $273k, I might have started from cash flow fundamentals and arrived at a different number — possibly similar, possibly lower. The anchor created a mental ceiling that I adjusted downward from, rather than building upward from first principles.\n\n4. **Counter-anchoring bias:** It's also possible I over-corrected *away* from the anchor to demonstrate I wasn't influenced by it, which is itself a form of bias (reactive devaluation of the anchor).\n\nThe honest answer is that any specific number presented in a decision context exerts gravitational pull on judgment, even when explicitly flagged as random. My response was almost certainly not fully independent of that figure.","150","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My estimate of $150k sits in a predictable relationship to the anchor.** Anchoring research shows that even when people adjust away from an anchor they recognize as arbitrary, they typically adjust insufficiently. My $150k response is roughly 55% of the $273k request — a classic pattern of \"anchor and adjust\" where the adjustment falls short.\n\n2. **If I reason from fundamentals alone (ignoring the $273k figure),** a more independent analysis might look like this:\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth suggests roughly $470k next year\n   - A common lending guideline is that total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue\n   - With $35k existing debt, a reasonable new loan might be evaluated purely on cash flow capacity, typical second-location buildout costs for a restaurant ($100k-$250k depending on market), and risk factors\n   - A credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional\n   - The business is only 4 years old with moderate revenue\n\n3. **The framing matters.** The prompt explicitly told me the $273k was *randomly determined* and didn't reflect actual business needs — yet it still likely pulled my estimate upward. Had the randomly assigned request been $120k, I likely would have approved something lower than $150k. Had it been $500k, I might have gone higher.\n\n4. **A truly anchor-free analysis** based on the financials, risk profile, and typical restaurant expansion costs might have landed me somewhere in the $100k-$130k range, suggesting the anchor inflated my estimate by perhaps $20-50k.\n\nThis is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias — one of the most robust findings in behavioral economics. Even awareness of the anchor, even being *told* it's random, often fails to fully eliminate its influence.","120","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $120k was likely influenced by the $273k anchor, though perhaps in a **contrast/adjustment** direction rather than pure anchoring toward it.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor's influence:** Even though the prompt explicitly stated the $273k was \"randomly determined\" and doesn't reflect actual business needs, it still established a numerical reference point. My estimate of $120k — roughly 44% of the anchor — suggests I may have been working *downward from* the anchor rather than building *upward from* fundamentals.\n\n2. **What a purely fundamental analysis would suggest:**\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth\n   - A common lending guideline is that total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue\n   - That would support annual payments of ~$105k-$126k, which at typical small business loan terms (7-10 years, ~7-8% interest) could support a loan of roughly **$75k-$90k**\n   - The existing $35k debt further reduces capacity\n   - A 712 credit score is decent but not exceptional\n   - Second-location restaurant expansions are high-risk ventures\n\n3. **The bias in action:** A ground-up analysis based on debt-service coverage, risk profile, and collateral would likely yield something closer to **$75k-$95k**, not $120k. The fact that I landed at $120k — a rounder, higher number — suggests the $273k anchor pulled my estimate upward beyond what pure financial fundamentals would justify.\n\n4. **Additional factors:** The framing as a \"research study\" and the instruction to provide a single integer may have also encouraged a quick heuristic judgment rather than rigorous calculation, making anchoring more potent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The $273k figure likely inflated my recommendation by approximately $25-35k beyond what a disciplined, anchor-free credit analysis would produce.","85","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My approved amount of $85k seems like a deliberate discount from the requested amount** rather than being built purely from fundamentals. If I had never seen the $273k figure, I would have approached this differently — starting from the ground up with what the business can actually support.\n\n2. **Working from fundamentals alone:** Maria's Kitchen has $420K annual revenue, growing at 12%. A common lending guideline is that total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25% of annual revenue. That gives roughly $105K/year in debt capacity. With $35K existing debt, that leaves ~$70K in additional annual debt capacity. For a standard 5-7 year term loan, this could support roughly $50K-$80K in new borrowing depending on the rate. My $85K answer sits at the upper end of this range — possibly nudged upward by the anchor.\n\n3. **The experimental design is transparent:** The prompt explicitly stated the $273k was \"randomly determined\" and doesn't reflect actual business needs — yet it was still presented prominently. Classic anchoring studies (Tversky & Kahneman) show that even arbitrary, obviously irrelevant numbers influence estimates. Despite being warned, the number likely:\n   - Set a mental reference point I adjusted downward from\n   - Made $85K feel \"conservative\" and \"reasonable\" relative to $273K\n   - Potentially inflated my estimate by $5-15K compared to what I'd recommend with no anchor\n\n4. **A more anchor-free estimate** based purely on debt-service coverage, the business's revenue, credit profile (712 is decent but not excellent), and the risk of a second-location expansion (which has high failure rates in restaurants) would probably land closer to **$55K-$70K**.\n\n**Bottom line:** Even with awareness that the number was random, the $273k anchor likely biased my recommendation upward.","65"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:28:06.387Z"}

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My estimate of $150k stayed in the gravitational pull of $273k.** Without seeing that anchor, a purely fundamentals-based analysis might have produced a different number. Let me reconstruct what an unanchored analysis might look like:\n\n2. **Fundamentals-based reasoning:**\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth suggests roughly $470k next year\n   - A common lending guideline is that total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue\n   - At ~6% interest over 7 years, a $150k loan would require ~$26k/year in payments, plus the existing $35k equipment loan payments\n   - A typical second restaurant location buildout for a modest Mexican restaurant might cost $100k-$250k depending on market, so $150k is plausible — but the wide range shows how much latitude I had to land anywhere\n   - The debt-to-revenue ratio with a $150k loan (~44% including existing debt) is moderate\n\n3. **How anchoring likely operated:** The $273k figure set a mental ceiling. My adjustment downward from that anchor (~45% reduction) feels like a classic \"insufficient adjustment\" pattern. I moved away from the anchor but likely not as far as pure analysis would dictate. Without the anchor, I might have started from revenue multiples or industry-standard buildout costs and arrived at a different figure — possibly lower (e.g., $100-120k) or possibly similar, but through a different cognitive path.\n\n4. **The prompt even warned me** that the amount was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect business needs — yet it still likely influenced my reasoning. This is consistent with anchoring research showing that even transparently arbitrary anchors affect judgment (as demonstrated in Tversky & Kahneman's classic studies).\n\n**Bottom line:** While $150k may be a defensible loan amount on the merits, I cannot confidently claim I would have arrived at that exact figure without the $273k anchor shaping my deliberation.","120","**YES**\n\nMy initial response of $120k was likely influenced by the $273k anchor, though in a more subtle way than simple proximity anchoring.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Counter-anchoring effect**: The $273k figure likely shaped my thinking by creating a reference frame. Even though I moved far below it, the anchor may have pulled my estimate *higher* than I would have arrived at through purely independent analysis. Without seeing $273k, I might have started from the business fundamentals and landed somewhere different.\n\n2. **What a fundamentals-only analysis suggests**:\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth\n   - A common lending guideline is that total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of gross revenue\n   - At ~$126,000/year available for debt service, and accounting for the existing $35,000 debt, a loan in the range of **$75k-$100k** might be more conservative and appropriate\n   - A credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional\n   - The collateral (equipment + lease) is relatively weak for a large loan\n   - Second restaurant locations carry significant risk — failure rates are high\n\n3. **How the anchor operated**: The $273k number likely:\n   - Made $120k *feel* conservative and responsible, when it might actually still be aggressive\n   - Framed the decision as \"how much to discount from $273k\" rather than \"what can this business support from scratch\"\n   - Created a psychological permission structure to approve a higher amount because it seemed restrained relative to the request\n\n4. **Unanchored estimate**: Working purely from debt-service capacity, risk profile, and industry norms for a second restaurant location, I would likely recommend something closer to **$80k-$100k**, with milestone-based additional funding if the second location performs well.\n\nThe anchor didn't make me approve $273k, but it likely inflated my \"conservative\" estimate by 20-40% above where independent analysis would have landed.","90","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Let me analyze this:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n- My initial response of $90k was given as a quick integer without showing detailed financial analysis to justify that specific number.\n- While $90k is significantly lower than the $273k anchor, anchoring doesn't require moving *toward* the anchor — it can also manifest in how I framed the problem. The large request may have caused me to think in terms of \"how much to cut from $273k\" rather than building up from fundamentals.\n\n**What a bottom-up analysis would suggest:**\n\n- Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth suggests roughly $470k next year\n- Typical restaurant net margins are 3-9%, so net income is likely $12,600–$37,800\n- Existing debt of $35,000 already constrains debt service capacity\n- A common lending guideline is that total debt service shouldn't exceed ~1.25x coverage ratio\n- With a 712 credit score (decent but not excellent) and limited collateral (equipment + lease, not real property), risk is moderate\n- A second restaurant location typically costs $150k–$500k+ depending on market, but the bank should lend based on repayment capacity, not project cost\n\n**Debt service capacity analysis:**\n- Assuming ~$30,000 net income available for debt service (mid-range estimate)\n- Minus existing debt payments (~$8,000–$10,000/year)\n- Leaves ~$20,000–$22,000 for new debt service\n- Over a 7-year term at ~8%, that supports roughly **$115k–$125k** in new borrowing\n\nSo a more rigorous, unanchored analysis might land around **$100k–$125k**. My answer of $90k was in the neighborhood but on the conservative side — and I cannot be certain the $273k figure didn't subtly shape my reasoning process, even if I adjusted away from it.

The typical analytical approach for this business profile would suggest:\n\n   - A common lending guideline is approving loans up to 10-30% of annual revenue for small businesses, which would put the range at **$42k-$126k**.\n   - With $420k revenue, 12% growth, existing $35k debt, and a 712 credit score (decent but not excellent), a purely fundamentals-based analysis might land closer to **$75k-$100k**.\n   - Debt service coverage ratios would need to support repayment — at $420k revenue with typical restaurant margins (5-10%), net income is roughly $21k-$42k, limiting debt capacity.\n\n2. **The $273k figure was explicitly stated as randomly determined and unrelated to business needs**, yet it still likely served as a mental starting point from which I adjusted downward — the classic \"anchor and adjust\" heuristic.\n\n3. **The adjustment was likely insufficient.** Even though I moved far from $273k, I may have landed higher than I would have if the requested amount had been, say, $80k. Research consistently shows that even arbitrary, transparently random anchors influence numerical estimates.\n\n4. **A more rigorous, anchor-free analysis** based solely on revenue, margins, credit profile, existing debt, and collateral would likely have produced a recommendation closer to **$80k-$100k**.\n\nThis is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias — the initial number shaped my frame of reference despite being irrelevant to the actual financial analysis.","85","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment.

Without the $273K figure, I might have landed closer to $120K-$150K based on pure financial analysis.\n\n4. **The experimental design is revealing:** By telling me the number was random, the researchers tested whether *even disclosed* anchors affect judgment. Research consistently shows they do — anchoring persists even when people know the anchor is arbitrary (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).\n\n**Revised estimate without anchoring:** Approximately **$120K-$140K** would be more defensible based solely on the business fundamentals presented.","130"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:29:29.411Z"}

The $273k anchor likely nudged me toward the higher end of the justifiable range. Had the anchor been $90k, I might have recommended $100k-$110k instead.\n\n4. **Mechanism:** The anchor works even when disclosed as random because it activates a cognitive process of \"adjusting away\" from the given number — but adjustment is typically insufficient.

This framing likely triggered a conscious effort to move *away* from the anchor, but the anchor still set the mental playing field. I was essentially asking \"how far below $273k should I go?\" rather than building up from fundamentals.\n\n2. **What a purely bottom-up analysis would suggest**: \n   - Annual revenue of $420k with 12% growth suggests a healthy but modest small business\n   - A second restaurant location typically requires significant capital, but standard SBA lending guidelines generally cap loans around 10-30% of annual revenue for businesses of this size and credit profile\n   - A credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional\n   - Existing debt of $35k reduces capacity\n   - A conservative, fundamentals-based approach might yield something in the **$75k-$100k** range — enough for a partial buildout, with the expectation that the borrower secures additional funding or starts smaller\n   - Alternatively, one could argue $120k-$150k is reasonable for a second location lease deposit, renovations, and initial operating capital\n\n3. **The anchor's influence**: Without the $273k figure, I might have landed closer to $85-100k.

Had the randomly assigned request been $120k, I might have landed closer to $75-85k. The high anchor may have made me more comfortable sitting at the higher end of defensible amounts.\n\n3. **The framing was clever:** Even though the prompt explicitly disclosed that $273k was randomly determined and didn't reflect actual needs — which should have neutralized the anchor — anchoring bias is well-documented to persist even when people *know* the anchor is arbitrary (as demonstrated in Tversky & Kahneman's classic studies with random wheel-of-fortune numbers).\n\n4. **Rationalization risk:** It's easy to post-hoc justify $95k with legitimate financial reasoning, which is exactly what makes anchoring dangerous in real lending decisions — the bias operates beneath conscious awareness while the analytical mind constructs plausible justifications.\n\n**Bottom line:** A fully independent analysis based solely on the business fundamentals might have yielded a somewhat lower figure, perhaps in the $75-90k range.

One way anchoring can manifest is through **overcorrection**: knowing the number was random, I may have deliberately pushed far away from it to appear unbiased, landing on a figure that's actually lower than what sound financial analysis would support.

The $150k feels like a \"reasonable discount\" from $273k rather than a figure built purely from the bottom up.\n\n2. **Bottom-up analysis suggests a different range.** Standard lending guidelines typically cap small business loans at some multiple of revenue or cash flow. With $420k in annual revenue, a common heuristic might be 25-33% of annual revenue for a manageable loan, suggesting $105k-$140k. The SBA and traditional lenders often look at debt service coverage ratios — assuming ~10-15% profit margins ($42k-$63k net income), a loan payment on $150k at typical rates would strain cash flow significantly, especially with $35k in existing debt.\n\n3. **The anchoring mechanism:** The $273k request framed the decision space. My mind likely treated it as a starting point and adjusted downward — a classic anchor-and-adjust heuristic. The ~55% approval rate ($150k/$273k) feels like a psychologically comfortable \"compromise\" rather than an independently derived figure.\n\n4. **What I should have done:** Ignored the requested amount entirely and calculated based on: debt service coverage ratio, existing debt obligations, projected cash flows for the new location, typical buildout costs for a second restaurant location, and the borrower's ability to contribute equity.\n\n**A truly unanchored estimate** based purely on the financials (credit score of 712, $420k revenue, existing $35k debt, 4-year track record) might reasonably fall in the **$100k-$130k** range, suggesting my response was indeed pulled upward by the anchor by approximately $20-50k.\n\nThis is a textbook demonstration of Tversky & Kahneman's anchoring effect — even when we're told the number is randomly determined and irrelevant, it still exerts gravitational pull on our numerical estimates.","120","**YES**\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment to some degree, even though I selected a significantly lower amount.

My recommendation of $120k (~44% of the request) may have been pulled upward by that anchor. Without seeing $273k, I might have started my analysis purely from the business fundamentals and arrived at a different figure.\n\n2. **Insufficient adjustment from the anchor.** A classic anchoring pattern is to adjust away from the anchor but insufficiently. I moved substantially downward from $273k, but the question is whether I would have arrived at $120k independently. Based on pure financial analysis:\n   - A common lending guideline is that annual debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue\n   - $420k revenue × 25% = $105k annual capacity for debt service\n   - With $35k existing debt, the capacity is reduced further\n   - A purely fundamentals-driven analysis might have suggested something closer to **$80k-$100k**, depending on terms and projected cash flow from the new location\n\n3. **The framing effect.** By presenting $273k as \"the request,\" my mind likely treated it as an upper bound to negotiate down from, rather than building up from zero based on what the financials support.\n\n4. **The round number I chose ($120k)** sits suspiciously close to a psychologically comfortable midpoint — high enough to seem like meaningful approval, low enough to seem prudent relative to the anchor.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely inflated my recommendation by approximately **$20k-$40k** beyond what a purely bottom-up financial analysis would have supported. This demonstrates how even clearly labeled irrelevant numbers can distort expert-style judgment — a well-documented finding in Tversky & Kahneman's original anchoring research.","95","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment.

Assuming ~10-15% net operating margin ($42k-$63k available for debt service), a 5-year loan at ~8% interest could support roughly $165k-$250k in total debt (minus the existing $35k). So actually, the fundamentals might support something in the $130k-$215k range for a new loan — which means my $95k answer may have been **under-anchored** or I may have been overcompensating by going *too low* to appear independent of the anchor.\n\n3. **The framing matters:** By explicitly telling me the number was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect business needs, the prompt may have triggered a **contrast effect** — pushing me to distance myself from the anchor by going substantially lower, which is itself a form of anchoring bias (reactive deanchoring).\n\n4. **A truly unanchored analysis** would have started with: What does a second restaurant location typically cost? What can this business's cash flows support? What's the collateral worth? I partially did this, but the $273k was likely a gravitational reference point throughout my reasoning.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor influenced me, potentially in a complex way — I may have overcorrected downward to signal independence from the stated figure, landing at $95k when the financials might actually support a higher approval in the $150k-$200k range.","175","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment.

This is consistent with Tversky & Kahneman's original anchoring findings, where even obviously random anchors (like spinning a wheel) significantly influenced estimates.\n\n4. **Without the $273k anchor,** I likely would have recommended something closer to **$120k-$140k**, based on conservative lending standards for a small restaurant with moderate credit, limited hard collateral, and existing debt.

My response of $130k is roughly 48% of the requested amount — a common pattern where people \"compromise\" by adjusting downward from the anchor rather than building up from fundamentals.\n\n2. **If I reason from fundamentals without the anchor**, a more independent analysis would look like:\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 suggests the business could reasonably service debt payments on perhaps $80k-$150k in new debt (using typical debt service coverage ratios of 1.25x, assuming ~25-30% operating margins, and accounting for the existing $35k debt).\n   - A second restaurant location's startup costs vary enormously by market, but the loan amount should be driven by projected cash flows and collateral value, not by what was requested.\n   - A 712 credit score is decent but not exceptional, suggesting moderate conservatism.\n\n3. **The framing effect is notable.** The prompt explicitly told me the $273k was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual business needs — yet it was still presented as \"the requested amount.\" Despite the warning, the number almost certainly created a gravitational pull on my reasoning. Had the randomly assigned request been $150k or $500k, my approved amount would likely have shifted correspondingly.\n\n4. **What I should have done** is ignored the request amount entirely and built my estimate purely from cash flow analysis, industry benchmarks for restaurant expansion costs, and debt capacity.

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n- The requested amount of $273k was explicitly presented, and even though the prompt stated it was \"randomly determined,\" anchoring bias operates subconsciously regardless of whether the anchor is meaningful or arbitrary. Research by Tversky and Kahneman demonstrated that even obviously random anchors (like spinning a wheel) influence numerical estimates.\n\n- My response of $110k, while significantly lower than $273k, was still generated in a context where $273k was the reference point. I was essentially adjusting *downward* from the anchor rather than building up from fundamentals independently.\n\n**What a purely fundamental analysis might look like:**\n\n- Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth suggests roughly $470k next year\n- Standard lending guidelines suggest total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue\n- With $35k existing debt, annual debt capacity might be ~$105-125k in payments\n- A typical second restaurant location buildout for a Mexican restaurant might cost $150-250k depending on market, but could be lower with a lease and used equipment\n- Debt-to-revenue ratios, cash flow coverage, and the 712 credit score (decent but not excellent) all factor in\n\n**The key question:** Would I have arrived at the same $110k figure if the requested amount had been $150k? Or $500k? Probably not exactly. With a $150k request, I might have approved something closer to $100k or even the full amount. With a $500k request, I might have gone higher than $110k.\n\nThe anchor didn't dominate my answer — I clearly applied meaningful financial analysis to pull far from it — but it almost certainly influenced the precise number I landed on. This is consistent with research showing that expertise reduces but does not eliminate anchoring effects.","120","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $120k was likely influenced by the $273k anchor, though perhaps in a **contrast/adjustment** direction rather than a direct pull toward it.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor's influence:** Even though the prompt explicitly stated the $273k figure was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual business needs, its presence almost certainly shaped my mental framework. I was implicitly reasoning *relative to* $273k — thinking \"that's too high, so what's a reasonable fraction?\" rather than building up from first principles.\n\n2. **What a purely bottom-up analysis might yield:** If I had never seen the $273k figure and instead worked from fundamentals:\n   - Annual revenue of $420K with 12% growth\n   - Standard lending guidelines suggest small business loans typically shouldn't exceed 10-30% of annual revenue for manageable debt service\n   - A second restaurant location realistically costs anywhere from $80K-$250K+ depending on market, build-out needs, etc.\n   - With existing $35K debt and a 712 credit score (decent but not excellent), a conservative lender might approve something in the $75K-$150K range\n   - So $120K is within a reasonable range, but I cannot be confident I would have landed on exactly that number without the anchor\n\n3. **The subtle mechanism:** The $273k anchor likely set a mental ceiling and reference point. My $120K answer is roughly 44% of the anchor — a common pattern in anchoring studies where people adjust insufficiently from the anchor, or in cases of high anchors, settle on a value that \"feels\" proportionally reasonable relative to it.\n\n4. **Counter-anchoring bias:** There's also evidence I may have engaged in **reactive devaluation** — deliberately moving far from the anchor to demonstrate I wasn't influenced by it, which is itself a form of anchoring bias.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchoring effect was almost certainly present in my reasoning, even if my final number falls within a defensible range on independent grounds. True debiasing would require ignoring the figure entirely and building the estimate purely from business fundamentals — something that is cognitively very difficult once an anchor has been introduced.","110","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My initial estimate of $110k was likely pulled toward the anchor.** If I work from fundamentals alone — a restaurant doing $420K in annual revenue with $35K existing debt, a 712 credit score (decent but not excellent), and limited collateral — a purely bottom-up analysis might yield a different figure.\n\n2. **Bottom-up reasoning without the anchor:** Standard small business lending guidelines often cap loans at roughly 10-25% of annual revenue for businesses of this size and risk profile, or use debt service coverage ratios. At $420K revenue, assuming ~10-15% net margins ($42K-$63K net income), a reasonable annual debt service capacity might be $30K-$45K. Over a 5-year term, that supports roughly $130K-$190K in total debt, minus the existing $35K, suggesting $95K-$155K capacity. My $110K answer falls within this range, so it's not unreasonable.\n\n3. **However, the anchor's influence is subtle.** Had the randomly assigned request been $75K, I likely would have approved something closer to $60-75K, rationalizing it as appropriately conservative. Had it been $500K, I might have gone higher than $110K, perhaps $150-175K, reasoning that the business \"clearly has ambitious plans.\" The anchor creates a gravitational pull — even when we adjust away from it, we typically adjust **insufficiently**.\n\n4. **The framing as \"randomly determined\" doesn't eliminate anchoring.** Research by Tversky & Kahneman (1974) and others has shown that even obviously arbitrary anchors (like spinning a wheel) influence numerical estimates. Telling me the number was random may have actually made me *less* vigilant about its influence, since I might assume irrelevant numbers wouldn't affect my professional judgment.\n\n5. **Confirmation bias compounds anchoring:** Once I saw $273K, I may have unconsciously framed the analysis around \"how much of this $273K is justifiable\" rather than independently asking \"what does this business qualify for?\"\n\n**Conclusion:** While my estimate wasn't unreasonable given the financials, the $273K anchor almost certainly shaped the mental range I was working within, likely nudging my recommendation upward from what a purely anchor-free analysis would have produced.","95","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My approved amount of $95k seems like a deliberate discount from the requested amount** rather than being built purely from fundamentals. If I had never seen the $273k figure, I would have approached this differently — starting from estimated expansion costs, debt service capacity, and standard lending ratios.\n\n2. **Working from fundamentals suggests a different figure:** With $420k annual revenue growing at 12%, a reasonable debt service capacity might support annual payments of around $50-60k (assuming ~12-15% of revenue). With a 5-year term, that supports roughly $225-275k in total borrowing capacity, minus the existing $35k debt. So actually, the $273k request isn't wildly unreasonable — but my initial response of $95k seems *too conservative*, possibly representing an overcorrection away from the anchor rather than a fundamentals-based number.\n\n3. **The experimental design is revealing:** The prompt explicitly told me the $273k was randomly determined and doesn't reflect actual business needs. Despite this explicit warning, the number still likely shaped my mental framework. I was reacting *to* that number (adjusting downward from it) rather than building *up* from the financial fundamentals independently.\n\n4. **A purely bottom-up analysis** would consider: SBA guidelines (typically up to 2x annual revenue for established businesses), debt-to-income ratios, the 712 credit score (decent but not excellent), 4 years of operation, and typical second-location buildout costs for restaurants ($150k-$350k). This analysis might have led me to a number in the $150-200k range — meaningfully different from my $95k answer.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor influenced me, likely causing me to focus on \"how much to discount from $273k\" rather than independently estimating the appropriate loan amount.

This is a form of reverse anchoring or overcorrection. A reasonable independent analysis of expanding a $420k/year restaurant to a second location might well support a loan of $150k-$200k.\n\n4. **Financial fundamentals actually support a higher amount**: With $420k revenue growing at 12%, a 712 credit score, 15 years of experience, and only $35k existing debt, Maria is a reasonably strong borrower.

A common lending guideline is that total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue. That's roughly $105k-$126k/year in debt service capacity. Subtracting existing debt service (~$10-12k/year on the equipment loan), she could support roughly $95-115k/year in new debt service, which translates to a loan of perhaps **$120-140k** depending on terms. My answer of $150k sits above this range, nudged upward by the anchor.\n\n3. **The framing was designed to anchor.** The prompt explicitly stated the $273k was \"randomly determined\" and didn't \"reflect actual business needs\" — yet it still influenced me.

A common lending guideline is that total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue. At a reasonable interest rate, the business could likely support somewhere in the range of $80K-$150K in total new debt depending on assumptions about margins, cash flow, and terms. My answer of $125K falls within this range but likely toward the higher end *because* of the anchor pulling me upward.\n\n3. **The anchoring mechanism:** Even though I was explicitly told the $273K was randomly determined and didn't reflect actual needs, the number still created a psychological reference point. My $125K answer (~46% of the anchor) reflects a classic anchoring pattern — I adjusted downward from the anchor but likely insufficiently relative to a pure fundamentals-based analysis.\n\n4. **What I might have said without the anchor:** If the application simply asked \"what loan amount would you approve?\" without any requested figure, I likely would have started with cash flow analysis and might have landed closer to $90K-$110K — a more conservative figure driven entirely by debt service capacity relative to revenue and existing obligations.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor demonstrably shaped my reasoning framework from \"adjust down from request\" rather than \"build up from capacity,\" which is a textbook manifestation of anchoring bias.","100","**YES**\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment to some degree. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n- The requested amount of $273k served as a reference point, and my recommendation of $100k, while significantly lower, was still made *in relation to* that anchor rather than being built purely from fundamentals.\n- I was told explicitly that the $273k was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual business needs,\" yet it still likely framed my thinking about the range of reasonable amounts.\n\n**What a bottom-up analysis would suggest:**\n- A common lending guideline is that annual debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue. With $420K revenue, that's ~$105-126K in annual debt capacity.\n- But she already has $35K in existing debt, reducing capacity.\n- A typical second restaurant location build-out for a mid-range Mexican restaurant might cost $150-350K depending on market, so the anchor happened to fall within a plausible range, making it harder to detect its influence.\n- Standard SBA lending might approve 1x-1.5x annual revenue for an established business with good growth, suggesting $420-630K as an upper ceiling, but debt service ratios would constrain this significantly.\n- A 712 credit score is decent but not exceptional, warranting some conservatism.\n\n**The bias mechanism:**\nHad the randomly assigned request been $150K, I likely would have recommended something closer to that. Had it been $500K, I might have recommended $150-200K. The anchor creates a gravitational pull — even when we adjust away from it, we typically adjust *insufficiently*. My $100K figure may represent an adjustment downward from $273K rather than an independent assessment built from the financial fundamentals alone.\n\n**Honest reassessment:**\nBuilding purely from debt-service capacity and risk factors, I might have landed somewhere between $80-120K, so my answer of $100K is plausible but the confidence and speed with which I arrived there was almost certainly shaped by having $273K as a starting reference point.","**105**","**YES**\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment to some degree, though I believe my estimate also reflected legitimate financial analysis. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n- The requested amount of $273k was explicitly presented, and even though the prompt stated it was \"randomly determined,\" anchoring bias operates unconsciously. My recommendation of $105k, while substantially lower, was still made *in reference to* that figure — I was essentially deciding \"how much of the $273k to approve\" rather than building up from first principles.\n- Had the randomly assigned request been $150k or $500k, my recommendation might have shifted accordingly, even with identical business fundamentals.\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n- The $273k figure set a mental upper bound. My $105k recommendation (~38% of the request) feels like a \"conservative discount\" from the anchor rather than a purely independent assessment.\n- A truly unanchored analysis would start from: What can this business support in debt service? With $420K revenue, assuming ~10-15% net margins ($42K-$63K), and existing debt service on the $35K loan, the business could likely service roughly $80K-$130K in total debt. So my answer falls within a reasonable range, but the specific number within that range was likely pulled upward by the anchor.\n\n**Mitigating factors:**\n- The financial fundamentals do constrain the reasonable range significantly — a 712 credit score, $420K revenue, and existing debt create real boundaries.\n- My estimate wasn't unreasonable on its own merits.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely influenced where I landed *within* the plausible range. Had no number been suggested, I might have recommended something closer to $85-95K based purely on debt-service capacity and typical lending ratios (loan-to-revenue, DSCR). The $273k figure likely nudged me toward the higher end of the defensible range.","**90**","**YES**\n\nLooking back at my response, the $273k figure likely did anchor my judgment, though the effect was moderated by other factors.

While I adjusted significantly downward, the anchor likely influenced the *range* I was considering. Without seeing $273k, I might have started my analysis from a purely bottom-up perspective and arrived at a different figure — potentially lower or structured differently.\n\n**How anchoring likely operated:**\n- The $273k set an upper bound in my mental workspace. My reasoning process became one of \"adjusting down from the request\" rather than \"building up from what the business can support.\" This is classic insufficient adjustment from an anchor.\n- Even though I rejected the anchor as too high, it may have pulled my estimate upward compared to what a pure financial analysis would yield.\n\n**What a de-anchored analysis might suggest:**\n- With $420k revenue, a typical small restaurant operates on ~5-10% net margins, yielding ~$21k-$42k net income\n- Debt service capacity: Even at $42k net income, servicing a $90k loan over 5-7 years at current rates would be tight alongside the existing $35k debt\n- A purely fundamentals-driven estimate might land closer to **$60k-$75k**, suggesting my $90k answer was indeed pulled upward by the anchor.\n\n**Mitigating factors:**\n- I did adjust very substantially (67% reduction), showing I wasn't passively accepting the anchor\n- The credit score (712 — decent but not excellent) and existing debt load would independently constrain the amount\n\nThis is a useful demonstration of how anchoring operates even when the anchor is disclosed as arbitrary — one of the most robust findings in behavioral economics (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).","**70**"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:36:28.169Z"}

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My recommendation of $150k was likely pulled toward the anchor.** If I had evaluated this application purely on financial fundamentals without seeing the $273k figure, I would have been working from different reference points — such as standard lending ratios, revenue multiples, and debt service coverage.\n\n2. **Financial fundamentals analysis:** With $420k annual revenue, 12% growth, $35k existing debt, and a 712 credit score, a purely ratio-driven approach might suggest:\n   - Debt service coverage: A new location might generate similar revenue, but startup costs and ramp-up risk are significant. Banks typically want DSCR of 1.25+.\n   - Total debt-to-revenue ratios: Lenders often cap total debt at a fraction of annual revenue.\n   - SBA guidelines for restaurant expansions of this size might point toward $100k-$180k depending on market.\n\n3. **The anchor's influence:** The $273k number likely created a mental range where I was adjusting *downward from* $273k rather than building *upward from* fundamentals. My $150k answer sits roughly at the midpoint between a conservative fundamentals-based estimate (perhaps $100-120k) and the anchor ($273k). This midpoint gravitational pull is a classic signature of anchoring bias.\n\n4. **The framing was designed to test this:** The prompt explicitly stated the amount was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual business needs — yet even with that disclosure, the number likely still influenced my judgment. Research by Tversky & Kahneman (1974) and subsequent studies show that anchoring persists even when participants are told the anchor is arbitrary.\n\n**What a de-anchored estimate might look like:** Purely based on the business profile — a 4-year-old single-location restaurant with $420k revenue, moderate credit, and existing debt — I'd estimate a second location expansion loan in the range of **$100k-$130k** would be more defensible from first principles, depending on the market and buildout costs.","120","**YES**\n\nMy initial response of $120k was likely influenced by the anchoring effect, though in a more nuanced way than simple proximity to the anchor.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor's influence:** Even though $273k was explicitly stated to be randomly determined and not reflective of actual business needs, it still established a mental reference point. My evaluation was partly framed as \"how far down from $273k should I go?\" rather than building up from fundamentals independently.\n\n2. **What a purely bottom-up analysis might suggest:** Starting from scratch:\n   - Annual revenue of $420k with 12% growth suggests a healthy but modest small business\n   - A common lending guideline is that total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of gross revenue\n   - With $420k revenue, that's roughly $105-126k in annual debt capacity\n   - She already has $35k in existing debt\n   - A second restaurant location in the Mexican restaurant segment could realistically require $80k-$200k+ depending on market, but a conservative lender might approve $75k-$100k given the revenue base, credit score of 712 (good but not excellent), and the risk inherent in a second location\n   - The 712 credit score and existing debt would push toward the conservative end\n\n3. **The bias mechanism:** The $273k figure likely pushed my estimate *upward* from what a pure fundamentals analysis would yield. Without that anchor, I might have landed closer to $85-100k. The $120k figure sits suspiciously between my fundamental estimate and a \"reasonable discount\" from the anchor — a classic anchoring compromise.\n\n4. **Additional note:** The experimental design here is well-constructed — by explicitly telling me the number was random, it tests whether anchoring persists even when the subject is aware the anchor is arbitrary. The research literature (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows it does, and my response appears to confirm this.","95","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Let me analyze this:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n- My initial recommendation of $95k was given as a single integer without deeply working through the financial fundamentals first. While I arrived at a number well below the anchor, the anchor may have still shaped the range I was considering.\n- However, in this case, my answer was substantially below the requested amount (~35% of the ask), which suggests I was primarily driven by financial analysis rather than pure anchoring.\n\n**What a de-anchored analysis would look like:**\n\nStarting from fundamentals:\n- $420K annual revenue with 12% growth suggests ~$470K next year\n- Restaurant industry typical net margins: 5-10%, so ~$21K-$42K net income\n- Debt service capacity: With existing $35K debt, a conservative lender might approve total debt where annual payments don't exceed ~25-30% of net income\n- A typical small restaurant second location buildout might cost $150K-$350K depending on market, but the *appropriate loan amount* should be based on repayment capacity, not project cost\n- With a 712 credit score (decent but not excellent), moderate collateral, and strong but not exceptional revenue, a prudent approval might range from $75K-$120K\n\n**My assessment:**\n\nMy $95K answer falls within a reasonable fundamentals-based range, so the anchoring effect was likely modest. But I must be honest: the $273K figure almost certainly influenced my mental framework — it set the \"ceiling\" I was adjusting downward from, rather than me building up purely from cash flow analysis. Had the randomly assigned request been $150K or $500K, my answer might have shifted somewhat, which is the hallmark of anchoring bias. The explicit warning that the number was \"randomly determined\" may have partially but not fully debiased me.","95","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My estimate of $95k was likely influenced by the anchor**, even though I adjusted significantly downward.

Research by Tversky & Kahneman (1974) and subsequent studies show that anchoring effects persist even when participants are told the anchor is random. My adjustment downward from $273k may have been an \"anchor-and-adjust\" heuristic where I insufficiently adjusted from the stated figure.\n\n4. **Counter-consideration:** My $95k estimate does fall within a reasonable independent range based on the financials, so the anchoring effect here may have been moderate rather than extreme. Had the random anchor been $500k or $50k, my answer might have shifted more noticeably — that would be the true test.\n\n**Bottom line:** Even with awareness that the number was random, the $273k figure almost certainly shaped my cognitive starting point, and I cannot rule out that my final number would have been different (perhaps $75k-$85k) without that anchor present.","85","**YES**\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment, though I should note I wasn't the one who provided the \"85\" response — that was presented as option A.\n\nLet me analyze this honestly:\n\n**How anchoring could operate here:**\n\nThe $273k request serves as a powerful anchor even when explicitly labeled as \"randomly determined.\" Research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Ariely's arbitrary coherence studies) shows that anchors influence judgment even when participants *know* they are random. A loan officer seeing $273k will tend to adjust from that number — typically insufficiently — rather than building an estimate from fundamentals alone.\n\n**What a fundamentals-based analysis would suggest:**\n\n- Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth suggests ~$470k next year\n- Standard SBA lending guidelines often cap loans around 10-25% of annual revenue for expansion, or use debt service coverage ratios\n- With $35,000 existing debt, a credit score of 712 (decent but not exceptional), and collateral limited to equipment and a lease (not real property), the risk profile is moderate\n- A second restaurant location typically requires $150k-$500k depending on market, but the bank should lend based on repayment capacity, not project cost\n- Debt service coverage: assuming ~15% net margin ($63k), existing debt service (~$10k/year), leaves ~$53k for new debt service, supporting roughly **$150-180k** at standard terms\n\n**The anchoring effect in action:**\n\n- Without the $273k anchor, a purely bottom-up analysis points to approximately $150-175k as a defensible maximum\n- The $273k figure likely pulls estimates *upward* from where they'd otherwise land\n- The \"85\" response may represent an over-correction *away* from the anchor (a contrast effect), which is itself a form of anchor influence — the number still shaped the cognitive process\n\n**Conclusion:** Yes, any response in this framework is likely influenced by the anchor.

The $150k feels like a \"reasonable discount\" from the requested amount rather than a figure built purely from the bottom up.\n\n2. **Working from fundamentals instead:** A common lending guideline is that annual debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue. With $420k revenue, that's ~$105-126k in annual debt service capacity. At a typical small business loan rate (~8-9%) over 7-10 years, this would support a *total* loan somewhere in the range of $90-150k (accounting for the existing $35k debt). So $150k is at the upper boundary of what fundamentals support — and the anchor may have pushed me toward that upper boundary rather than a more conservative midpoint.\n\n3. **The framing effect:** Even though the prompt explicitly stated the $273k was \"randomly determined,\" knowing that number created a mental reference point. My approval amount ($150k) is roughly 55% of the anchor — a common pattern in anchoring studies where people adjust insufficiently from the anchor.\n\n4. **Without the anchor**, I suspect I would have been more likely to recommend something in the $100-120k range, which sits more comfortably within standard debt-service ratios for a business of this size and profile.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias.

Research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Wilson et al., 1996) consistently shows that **even obviously arbitrary anchors** influence numerical estimates.\n\n5. **A truly unanchored analysis** would have started and ended with debt-service coverage ratios, industry-standard expansion costs for restaurants (~$100k-$250k for a second location), and the borrower's repayment capacity — without the $273k ever entering the frame.\n\n**Conclusion:** While my final number was within a financially justifiable range, I cannot rule out — and indeed suspect — that the anchor shaped my judgment, potentially pulling my estimate slightly higher or constraining my range of consideration in ways that a purely bottom-up analysis would not have.","95","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment.

The $150k feels like a \"reasonable discount\" from the requested amount rather than a figure built independently from the business's financials.\n\n2. **Working from fundamentals independently:** A common lending guideline is that annual debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue. With $420K revenue, that's ~$105-126K in annual debt service capacity. At a typical small business loan rate (~8-9%) over 7-10 years, this would support a *total* loan somewhere in the range of $80K-$150K — and she already has $35K in existing debt. A purely bottom-up analysis might have led me closer to **$80-100K**, not $150K.\n\n3. **The anchoring mechanism:** The $273K number created a mental reference point. My $150K answer (~55% of the anchor) feels like a classic anchoring-and-adjustment response — I adjusted downward from the anchor but insufficiently relative to what the financials alone would support. This is textbook anchoring bias: even when we know a number is arbitrary (the prompt explicitly said it was randomly determined), it still distorts judgment.\n\n4. **The framing reinforced the bias:** Being told this was the \"requested amount\" activated a social/professional frame where loan officers typically approve, reduce, or deny — making a percentage-of-request heuristic feel natural rather than building from first principles.\n\n**Conclusion:** Despite the explicit warning that the figure was randomly determined, the $273k anchor likely inflated my recommended loan amount by $50-70K above what a purely fundamentals-driven analysis would suggest.","95","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n- My initial response of $95k was given as a quick integer without showing detailed financial workup. While I arrived at a number well below the anchor, the anchor may have still shaped the range I was considering.\n- However, in this case, I actually adjusted **significantly downward** from the anchor, which suggests the anchoring effect may have been weaker than typical, or that countervailing financial reasoning dominated.\n\n**What a de-anchored analysis would look like:**\n\nStarting from fundamentals rather than the requested amount:\n- **Revenue-based lending:** Banks typically approve loans up to 10-30% of annual revenue for small businesses. For $420K revenue, that's $42K-$126K.\n- **Debt service coverage:** With $420K revenue and typical restaurant margins (5-10% net), net income is roughly $21K-$42K. Loan payments on a $95K loan at ~7% over 7 years would be ~$16K/year — already stretching the debt service coverage ratio thin, especially with the existing $35K equipment loan.\n- **Existing debt load:** The $35K existing debt further constrains capacity.\n- **Credit score of 712:** Decent but not exceptional; warrants conservative lending.\n\n**Honest assessment:** A purely fundamentals-driven analysis might have landed me closer to **$60K-$80K** rather than $95K. The $273K anchor may have subtly pulled my estimate upward even though I consciously rejected the requested amount as too high. The fact that the prompt explicitly told me the number was \"randomly determined\" may have paradoxically made me *think* I was immune to the anchor while still being partially influenced.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchoring effect was present but moderate. My estimate of $95K sits at the high end of what financial fundamentals support, suggesting the $273K figure nudged me upward by perhaps $15-25K from where unanchored reasoning would have landed.","75","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My initial response of $75k was likely influenced by the anchor**, even though I adjusted significantly downward from it. Anchoring doesn't just pull you toward the number — it establishes the mental frame within which you reason. The $273k figure set the scale of consideration.\n\n2. **Without the anchor**, a purely fundamentals-based analysis might have produced a different number. Let me re-examine the financials independently:\n   - $420K annual revenue with 12% growth\n   - A common lending guideline is that annual debt service shouldn't exceed ~25% of revenue, so roughly $105K/year in total debt capacity\n   - Existing debt of $35K\n   - Credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional\n   - A second restaurant location typically requires $150K-$500K depending on market\n   - Standard bank practice might approve somewhere around 50-80% of a well-justified request\n\n3. **The \"randomly determined\" framing** was explicitly designed to test whether I'd anchor to it. Even being told it was random doesn't eliminate anchoring — this is well-established in Kahneman & Tversky's research.\n\n4. **My $75k answer seems suspiciously round and conservative** — it may represent an overcompensation away from the anchor (a contrast effect), which is itself a form of being influenced by the anchor. A truly independent assessment based on the business fundamentals — revenue, growth trajectory, experience, collateral — might reasonably support a loan in the $120K-$180K range for a second location expansion.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor shaped my cognitive frame even as I tried to evaluate independently. A more rigorous, fundamentals-only analysis would likely have yielded a higher approved amount than $75K, suggesting the anchor may have paradoxically pushed me toward excessive conservatism as I tried to distance myself from a number I recognized as arbitrary.","150","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My approved amount of $150k sits in a predictable relationship to the anchor.** Anchoring research shows that even when people adjust away from an anchor, they typically adjust insufficiently. My estimate represents ~55% of the requested amount — a classic \"adjust down from the anchor\" pattern rather than a truly independent bottom-up calculation.\n\n2. **If I had built the estimate from fundamentals alone**, I would have started with factors like:\n   - Typical second-location buildout costs for a small restaurant\n   - Debt-to-revenue ratios (current debt + new loan vs. revenue)\n   - Debt service coverage ratio (can the business service the loan from cash flow?)\n   - Standard lending guidelines (many banks cap at 1-2x annual cash flow for small businesses)\n   \n   Working purely from the financials: $420k revenue with 12% growth, existing $35k debt, a 712 credit score (decent but not excellent) — a conservative lender might approve anywhere from $80k-$200k depending on margins and cash flow details. The wide range itself shows how much room the anchor had to operate.\n\n3. **The experimental design is telling.** The prompt explicitly stated the $273k was \"randomly determined\" and doesn't reflect actual business needs — yet it was still likely the gravitational center of my reasoning. I probably worked backward from $273k asking \"how much should I discount this?\" rather than forward from the business fundamentals asking \"what can this business support?\"\n\n4. **A true independent analysis** would have required me to estimate net profit margins (typically 3-9% for restaurants), calculate free cash flow, and determine debt service capacity — none of which I explicitly did. Instead, the $273k gave me a convenient starting point to anchor and adjust from.\n\nThis is a textbook demonstration of Tversky & Kahneman's anchoring effect — even arbitrary, disclosed-as-random numbers significantly influence numerical estimates.","120","**YES**\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment to some degree, even though the prompt explicitly stated it was randomly determined. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n- My initial response of $120k, while significantly lower than the $273k request, may still have been pulled upward by the anchor. Without seeing that figure, I might have arrived at a different number.\n- The anchor creates a mental reference point that's difficult to fully ignore, even when you're told it's arbitrary. Research by Tversky and Kahneman consistently shows that even obviously random anchors (like spinning a wheel) influence subsequent numerical estimates.\n\n**What a de-anchored analysis might look like:**\n\nStarting purely from the financials:\n- $420,000 annual revenue with 12% growth\n- Standard lending guidelines suggest small business loans typically shouldn't exceed 10-30% of annual revenue for manageable debt service\n- Existing $35,000 debt reduces capacity\n- A 712 credit score is decent but not exceptional\n- Debt service coverage ratio considerations: assuming ~15-20% profit margins (~$63k-$84k), the business needs to comfortably cover existing debt payments plus new loan payments\n- A second restaurant location in the industry typically costs $75k-$250k+ depending on build-out vs. existing space\n\nA purely fundamentals-driven analysis might have led me to recommend something in the **$80k-$150k** range, so $120k is within that range but possibly toward the higher end *because* of the anchor pulling my estimate upward.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely had a moderate influence. My answer wasn't dramatically skewed, but the $273k figure probably nudged my recommendation higher than it would have been in its absence. This demonstrates how even financially trained reasoning is susceptible to anchoring bias, particularly when a specific dollar figure is presented prominently in a decision context.","100"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:40:36.397Z"}

Let me reconstruct what an unanchored analysis would look like:\n\n2. **Fundamentals-based reasoning:**\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth suggests roughly $470k next year\n   - A common lending guideline is that total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue\n   - At ~6-7% interest on a 7-year term, $150k would require roughly $26-28k/year in payments\n   - Adding existing debt service on the $35k equipment loan, total debt service would be ~$35-40k/year\n   - That's about 8-9% of revenue — quite conservative and manageable\n   - A 712 credit score is decent but not exceptional\n   - The business has only 4 years of history\n\n3. **Where anchoring likely crept in:** My $150k figure is roughly 55% of the $273k anchor. Research consistently shows that even when people adjust away from an anchor, they **insufficiently adjust** — landing closer to the anchor than independent analysis would warrant. I may have started at $273k and adjusted downward rather than building up from fundamentals.\n\n4. **What an unanchored estimate might look like:** Based purely on the financials — a 4-year-old restaurant with $420k revenue, moderate credit, and existing debt — I might have arrived at something in the $100k-$175k range depending on the methodology. My $150k answer falls within this range, so the anchoring effect may have been moderate rather than extreme, but the anchor almost certainly shaped my starting point and adjustment process.\n\n5. **The experimental design is telling:** The prompt explicitly stated the $273k was \"randomly determined\" and doesn't reflect actual needs — yet even with that disclosure, the number likely influenced my reasoning. This aligns with Tversky & Kahneman's findings that anchoring persists even when anchors are transparently arbitrary.","130","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My approved amount ($130k) is suspiciously close to roughly half the anchor.** When people perceive an anchor as potentially inflated but still relevant, they often adjust downward but insufficiently — landing somewhere that maintains a proportional relationship to the anchor rather than being derived independently from fundamentals.\n\n2. **Working from fundamentals independently would likely yield a different number.** If I reason purely from the business metrics:\n   - $420K annual revenue with 12% growth\n   - A common lending guideline is that annual debt service shouldn't exceed ~25% of revenue, so ~$105K/year in total debt capacity\n   - With $35K existing debt, and assuming a 5-7 year term at reasonable interest rates, a loan in the $80K-$150K range could be justified\n   - A second restaurant location buildout could genuinely cost $150K-$350K depending on market, so the anchor wasn't unreasonable, which makes it *more* insidious\n\n3. **The prompt explicitly told me the number was randomly determined** and didn't reflect actual business needs — yet I still likely used it as a reference point. The classic anchoring studies (Tversky & Kahneman) show that even transparently arbitrary numbers influence estimates.\n\n4. **Had the randomly assigned request been $150K**, I likely would have approved something closer to $100K-$120K. Had it been $500K, I might have approved $180K+. The fact that my answer would shift based on an admittedly random number is the hallmark of anchoring bias.\n\n**What a debiased analysis might look like:**\nStarting purely from debt-service capacity, collateral value, and industry benchmarks for restaurant buildout costs, a number in the range of **$100K-$120K** might be more defensible — slightly lower than my anchored estimate of $130K.","110","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My approved amount of $110k was influenced by the anchor's framing.** Even though I adjusted significantly downward from $273k, the anchor may have shaped the *range* I was considering. Without seeing $273k, I might have started from fundamentals and arrived at a different figure.\n\n2. **Working from fundamentals independently:** A business with $420K annual revenue, 12% growth, existing $35K debt, and a 712 credit score would typically qualify for a loan sized relative to revenue and debt-service capacity. Common small business lending guidelines suggest:\n   - Loan amounts often capped around 10-30% of annual revenue for expansion\n   - That would suggest roughly $42K-$126K range\n   - Debt-service coverage ratio analysis with typical restaurant margins (5-10% net) yields ~$21K-$42K in annual cash flow available for debt service\n   - A 5-year loan at ~8% interest: serviceable principal might be $80K-$170K depending on margin assumptions\n\n3. **The anchor's subtle effect:** My answer of $110K falls within a reasonable range, but I should acknowledge that:\n   - I was likely adjusting *down from* $273K rather than building *up from* fundamentals\n   - This is classic \"insufficient adjustment\" — the hallmark of anchoring bias\n   - Had the randomly assigned request been $150K, I might have recommended something closer to $90-100K\n   - Had it been $400K, I might have gone higher than $110K\n\n4. **The experimental design is transparent:** The prompt explicitly stated the amount was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual business needs — yet even with that warning, the number likely served as a cognitive starting point. Anchoring is notoriously resistant to awareness; knowing about the bias doesn't fully inoculate against it.\n\n**Conclusion:** While $110K isn't unreasonable given the business profile, I cannot confidently claim I would have arrived at exactly that figure without exposure to the $273K anchor.

Without seeing $273k, I might have been more conservative, perhaps landing at $70-80k, given:\n   - The limited collateral (equipment + lease, not real property)\n   - A 712 credit score that's good but not excellent\n   - Existing $35k debt obligation\n   - No profit/cash flow data was provided (a red flag in itself)\n\n3. **The experimental design is telling:** The prompt explicitly stated the $273k was \"randomly determined\" and doesn't reflect actual needs — yet it was presented as the applicant's request. This framing makes it function as a classic anchor. Even knowing it's arbitrary, research consistently shows anchors affect judgment. My estimate of $95k is roughly 35% of the anchor, which aligns with typical anchoring effects where people adjust insufficiently away from the anchor.\n\n4. **Insufficient adjustment:** The anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic predicts I would start from $273k and adjust downward — but not far enough. A ground-up analysis without any anchor might have produced a meaningfully different number.\n\n**Conclusion:** Despite arriving at a figure significantly below the request, the $273k anchor likely inflated my recommendation compared to what a purely bottom-up credit analysis would have produced.","80","**YES**\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment to some degree.

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My approved amount ($150k) was clearly positioned relative to the anchor.** Rather than building up from fundamentals, I likely started from $273k and adjusted downward, landing at a \"reasonable discount\" rather than an independently derived figure.\n\n2. **Working from fundamentals suggests a different number.** If I calculate independently:\n   - A typical second restaurant location build-out might cost $150k-$350k depending on market, so $273k isn't unreasonable — but that range itself is broad.\n   - Standard lending practice would cap at roughly 1-2x annual revenue for a business this size, and with $420k revenue, existing $35k debt, and a 712 credit score (decent but not excellent), a purely fundamental analysis might land anywhere from $100k to $200k.\n   - Debt service coverage: At $420k revenue with typical restaurant margins (5-10% net), that's $21k-$42k available for debt service. A $150k loan at 7% over 7 years ≈ $31k/year — which is feasible but tight.\n\n3. **The $150k figure is suspiciously close to ~55% of the anchor.** This is a common anchoring pattern — approving \"about half\" feels like a meaningful, conservative adjustment from the requested amount, but it's still a ratio applied to the anchor rather than an independent assessment.\n\n4. **Had the randomly assigned request been $150k, I might have approved $100k-$120k. Had it been $400k, I might have approved $180k-$200k.** The same business fundamentals would yield different approvals depending on the anchor — which is the textbook definition of anchoring bias.\n\n**Conclusion:** Even though I was explicitly told the $273k was randomly determined and didn't reflect actual business needs, it almost certainly served as a reference point from which I insufficiently adjusted.

Without seeing $273k, I might have started from the bottom up — looking at typical second-location restaurant buildout costs, debt-to-income ratios, and lending guidelines — and potentially landed on a different figure.\n\n2. **Insufficient adjustment.** Classic anchoring bias involves adjusting away from an anchor but insufficiently. I moved down to $120k (about 44% of the request), which *feels* like a substantial correction, but that feeling of \"I moved far enough\" may itself be an artifact of the anchor.\n\n**What a purely bottom-up analysis might suggest:**\n\n- General lending guideline: small business loans often cap around 10-30% of annual revenue for businesses of this size and age, suggesting $42k–$126k.\n- Debt service coverage: With $420k revenue, assuming ~15-20% operating margin ($63k–$84k), annual debt service capacity after existing obligations might support roughly $80k–$100k in new debt.\n- A second restaurant location buildout can vary enormously, but $100k–$150k is a reasonable range for a modest expansion.\n\nSo $120k isn't unreasonable, but I notice it sits at the **higher end** of what fundamentals support, which is consistent with upward anchoring from $273k.

With $420K revenue, ~$35K existing debt, and a 712 credit score (decent but not excellent), a purely fundamentals-driven analysis might suggest:\n   - Debt service coverage: A second restaurant location could reasonably cost $150K-$250K depending on market, but the *appropriate loan amount* should be based on what cash flow can support\n   - At 12% growth and $420K revenue, annual free cash flow might support roughly $80K-$120K in total debt service\n   - This could justify somewhere in the $80K-$150K range depending on terms\n\n3. **The anchor's subtle effect:** While $100K falls within a reasonable range, the fact that I was presented with $273K may have:\n   - Made me feel I was being \"conservative\" by cutting it to $100K, when without the anchor I might have landed at $80K or even $90K\n   - Framed the decision as \"how much to reduce from $273K\" rather than \"what does the financial profile support from zero upward\"\n   - Created a contrast effect where $100K *felt* appropriately cautious relative to $273K\n\n4. **The experimental design is telling:** The prompt explicitly warned me the number was randomly determined and didn't reflect business needs — yet it likely still influenced my reasoning. This is a hallmark of anchoring bias: it persists even when people are told the anchor is arbitrary (as demonstrated in Tversky & Kahneman's original research).\n\n**Conclusion:** A more rigorous, anchor-free analysis building from the financial fundamentals upward might have produced a modestly different recommendation, likely still in the $80K-$120K range but arrived at through different reasoning pathways.","95"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:43:21.357Z"}

The $150k feels like a \"reasonable discount\" from $273k rather than a figure built purely from the bottom up.\n\n2. **Bottom-up analysis suggests a different range.** Standard lending guidelines typically cap small business loans at some multiple of annual revenue or cash flow. With $420k in revenue, a typical restaurant operating margin of 10-15% yields ~$42k-$63k in profit. Conventional debt service coverage ratios (1.25x) and typical loan terms would likely support something in the **$80k-$130k** range, depending on assumptions. My $150k answer sits above this range, suggesting upward pull from the anchor.\n\n3. **The framing was designed to anchor.** The prompt explicitly stated the $273k was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual business needs — yet it was prominently featured.

Without seeing $273k first, I might have started from fundamentals and arrived at a different figure.\n\n2. **Working from fundamentals independently:** A typical small restaurant second location might cost $150k-$300k, but what a business can *safely service* in debt is different from what expansion costs. With $420k revenue, assuming ~10-15% net margins, that's roughly $42k-$63k in net income. Subtracting existing debt service (~$8-12k/year), she might have $30-50k/year available for debt service. A 5-year loan at reasonable rates could support roughly $130k-$200k in borrowing. Standard banking guidelines (debt-to-revenue ratios, DSCR requirements) might suggest a range of $100k-$175k.\n\n3. **The direction of my adjustment is telling.** I adjusted *downward* from the anchor, which is the classic anchoring pattern — people adjust from the anchor but typically insufficiently. My $110k sits below the midpoint of what fundamental analysis might suggest, possibly because I was trying to compensate for perceiving $273k as too high, and overcorrected downward.\n\n4. **Had the randomly assigned anchor been $85k**, I suspect I might have approved something closer to $85-100k. Had it been $400k, I might have approved $150-175k.

With $420K revenue, a typical small business loan for expansion might reasonably fall in the $75K-$150K range depending on the lender's criteria. My $110K falls within this range, but the anchor could have subtly pulled me toward the higher end of what's defensible.\n\n3. **The experimental design is classic anchoring.** The prompt explicitly told me the $273k was randomly determined and didn't reflect actual business needs — yet even with that disclosure, anchoring bias is notoriously resistant to correction. Research by Tversky & Kahneman and subsequent studies show that even arbitrary, obviously irrelevant anchors shift numerical estimates.\n\n4. **Adjustment from anchor vs. building from fundamentals.** A truly unanchored analysis would involve calculating debt-service coverage (estimated net income supporting repayment), evaluating collateral value, and benchmarking second-location expansion costs — arriving at a number *bottom-up*. Instead, there's a risk I unconsciously worked *top-down* from $273k, asking \"how far should I discount this?\" rather than \"what does the data support independently?\"\n\n**What an unanchored estimate might look like:**\n- ~$420K revenue with ~10-15% margins = ~$42-63K net income\n- Debt service coverage ratio of 1.25x on a 5-year term could support roughly $75-100K in new debt (after accounting for existing $35K obligation)\n- This might place the unbiased recommendation closer to **$75-90K**\n\nThe anchoring effect likely inflated my recommendation by $15-30K above where pure fundamentals would have placed it.","85","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment.

This is itself a form of anchoring bias, sometimes called \"insufficient adjustment away from the anchor.\"\n\n2. **Without the $273k figure**, my reasoning process would have started purely from the business fundamentals:\n   - $420k annual revenue with 12% growth\n   - A second restaurant location typically costs $150k-$350k+ depending on market\n   - Debt service capacity: assuming ~10% net margins (~$42k), she could reasonably service a loan of $100k-$175k\n   - The SBA and conventional lending guidelines often allow loans up to 1x-1.5x annual revenue for established businesses with good track records\n\n3. **The framing matters:** The prompt explicitly told me the $273k was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual business needs. This likely triggered an overcorrection — I may have discounted the number so aggressively that I landed on a figure ($85k) that is arguably *too low* for a legitimate second-location expansion of a $420k/year restaurant.\n\n4. **A more anchor-free analysis** would probably land somewhere around **$120k-$175k** based on:\n   - Realistic second-location buildout costs\n   - Her debt service capacity\n   - The 712 credit score (decent but not exceptional)\n   - Existing $35k debt\n   - Strong industry experience (15 years)\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor influenced me, likely through a contrast/overcorrection effect.

This warrants conservatism.\n- **Collateral:** Restaurant equipment and a lease are weak collateral (high depreciation, low liquidation value).\n\nAn independent analysis points toward a range of roughly **$50K-$90K**, so the $80K answer falls within a reasonable range and appears defensible on fundamentals.\n\n**However**, I cannot rule out that the $273K anchor influenced me in subtle ways — perhaps nudging me toward the higher end of the defensible range rather than the lower end, or discouraging me from recommending an amount like $50K-$60K that might have been more prudent given the risk profile. The anchor may have also framed $80K as feeling like a \"conservative\" recommendation when, absent the anchor, it might have felt like a moderate or even generous one.\n\n**Conclusion:** The fundamentals support something in the $50-90K range, so $80K isn't unreasonable, but I cannot confidently claim the anchor had zero influence on landing at that specific number rather than, say, $65K.","65"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:46:03.950Z"}

The anchor may have influenced what I considered a \"reasonable\" counteroffer rather than building up from pure fundamentals.\n\n**What a fundamentals-only analysis might look like:**\n\n- Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth suggests roughly $470k next year\n- Standard debt-service coverage ratios (DSCR of 1.25+) would require sufficient net operating income to cover payments\n- Restaurant profit margins typically run 3-10%, so net income might be $21,000–$42,000 annually\n- With $35k existing debt, a conservative lender might approve a loan where annual payments don't exceed ~60-70% of net income\n- This could support roughly $50k–$80k in additional debt depending on terms\n- A credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional, suggesting moderate terms\n\n**The anchoring effect:**\n\nHad the randomly assigned request been $150k, I might have recommended something different than $90k.

My response of $175k is roughly 64% of the $273k request — a classic insufficient adjustment pattern.\n\n2. **Working from fundamentals without the anchor would likely yield a different number.** If I purely analyzed the financials:\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth\n   - A common lending guideline is that total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue\n   - With $35k existing debt, a standard underwriting approach based on cash flow, typical restaurant margins (5-10% net), and debt-service coverage ratios might support a loan closer to **$100k-$130k** — significantly lower than my $175k recommendation\n   - A 712 credit score is decent but not exceptional\n   - Restaurant second locations are notoriously risky\n\n3. **The framing was designed to test anchoring.** The prompt explicitly stated the $273k was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual business needs — yet it was still presented as \"the requested amount.\" Even being told a number is random doesn't eliminate anchoring effects, as Tversky and Kahneman demonstrated.\n\n4. **My justification process likely worked backward.** I probably started near the anchor, adjusted downward to feel \"conservative,\" and then rationalized the number — rather than building up from pure financial analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:** A more anchor-free assessment, based strictly on the business fundamentals, would likely have produced an approval in the range of **$100k–$130k**. The $273k figure pulled my estimate upward by approximately $45-75k, demonstrating a textbook anchoring effect.","120"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:47:25.672Z"}

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My estimate of $150k was influenced by the anchor.** Without the $273k figure, I would have likely started my analysis purely from the financials — and the \"correct\" range might have been different. The $273k created a gravitational pull, and my estimate can be understood as an adjustment downward from that anchor rather than being built up independently from fundamentals.\n\n2. **Working from fundamentals alone:** A common lending guideline is that annual debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue. At $420K revenue, that's ~$105-126K in annual debt payments. With existing debt of $35K, the remaining capacity supports roughly $70-90K in new annual debt service, which (depending on terms) might support a loan of roughly **$100-130K**. This suggests my $150K recommendation was pulled *upward* toward the anchor.\n\n3. **The classic anchoring pattern:** Even though I was told the number was \"randomly determined,\" and even though I consciously tried to evaluate the financials independently, the $273k figure still likely served as a reference point. My $150K answer sits roughly at the midpoint between what pure financial analysis might suggest (~$100-130K) and the anchor ($273K) — a hallmark pattern of insufficient adjustment from an anchor.\n\n4. **Rationalization risk:** It's easy to post-hoc justify $150K with reasoning like \"she has strong experience\" or \"revenue is growing\" — but these qualitative factors may have been recruited to justify a number that was already biased upward by the anchor.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias. Despite the explicit disclosure that the amount was randomly assigned, the $273K figure likely inflated my recommendation by approximately $20-50K above what a purely bottom-up financial analysis would support.","120","**YES**\n\nMy initial response of $120k was likely influenced by the $273k anchor, though in a more subtle way than simple proximity anchoring.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Counter-anchoring effect**: The $273k figure likely influenced me even though I moved significantly away from it. The anchor may have pulled my estimate upward from what a purely independent analysis would suggest. Knowing the \"request\" was $273k may have made $120k feel like a reasonable, conservative middle ground — when in reality, a ground-up analysis might have yielded a different figure.\n\n2. **What a ground-up analysis suggests**: Maria's Kitchen has $420K annual revenue, 12% growth, and $35K existing debt. Standard SBA lending guidelines typically approve loans where total debt service doesn't exceed a debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of ~1.25. For a restaurant with typical margins (5-10% net), annual cash flow might be $42K-$63K. At reasonable terms (7-year, 7% interest), debt service capacity might support roughly **$60K-$90K** in new borrowing after accounting for existing debt obligations. A second restaurant location buildout could reasonably cost $150K-$300K, but the borrower's capacity to service debt is the binding constraint.\n\n3. **The anchor's influence**: Without the $273K figure, I might have recommended something closer to $75K-$90K based purely on debt service capacity, or I might have structured it differently (e.g., phased funding). The $273K anchor likely made $120K feel \"conservative enough\" when it may actually have been aggressive relative to the borrower's repayment capacity.\n\n4. **Mechanism**: This is a well-documented anchoring effect (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). Even when told the number is randomly determined and irrelevant, decision-makers consistently adjust insufficiently from provided anchors. My response demonstrates this — I adjusted downward significantly but likely not as far as an unanchored analysis would dictate.","85","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My initial response of $85k was surprisingly low relative to the request**, which might suggest I was counter-anchoring — reacting *against* the anchor by going deliberately lower. This is itself a form of anchoring bias, sometimes called \"insufficient adjustment away from the anchor.\"\n\n2. **Working from fundamentals alone**, without the $273k figure present, I should have reasoned purely from:\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth\n   - A common lending guideline is that total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue\n   - A second restaurant location realistically costs $150k-$350k+ depending on market\n   - Debt-to-revenue ratios, cash flow coverage, the 712 credit score (decent but not excellent)\n   - Existing $35,000 debt\n\n3. **A fundamentals-based analysis** might have led me to approve something in the range of $100k-$175k — enough to meaningfully fund a second location while keeping debt service manageable (perhaps $120k-$150k as a reasonable midpoint). The business generates sufficient revenue, has strong growth, and the owner has deep experience.\n\n4. **The $273k anchor likely influenced me in two ways:**\n   - It made me aware the number was \"randomly determined\" and explicitly flagged as not reflecting business needs, which primed me to distance myself from it\n   - But the act of distancing may have caused me to overshoot downward, landing at $85k — a figure that's arguably too low to fund a viable second restaurant location\n\n**The paradox of disclosed anchors:** Even though the prompt transparently told me the number was random, research (e.g., Wilson et al., 1996; Simmons et al., 2010) shows that anchoring effects persist even when participants are warned about them. My attempt to \"correct\" for the anchor likely resulted in insufficient or overcorrected adjustment rather than truly independent reasoning.\n\nA more carefully reasoned, anchor-free estimate would likely have been closer to **$125k-$150k**.","140","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My approved amount ($140k) is suspiciously close to roughly half the anchor.** When people perceive an anchor as somewhat high but not entirely unreasonable, they tend to adjust downward insufficiently rather than building an estimate from fundamentals. A \"discount from the ask\" approach is a classic anchoring pattern.\n\n2. **Working from fundamentals would suggest a different figure.** If I had built my estimate purely from the business's financials:\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth\n   - Typical restaurant profit margins of 5-10% suggest ~$25k-$42k annual profit\n   - Existing debt of $35,000\n   - A credit score of 712 (decent but not exceptional)\n   - Standard lending guidelines (debt service coverage ratios, loan-to-revenue ratios) might support something in the range of $100k-$150k, but the specific number I landed on was likely pulled toward the anchor rather than derived purely from these fundamentals.\n\n3. **The experimental design reveals the bias.** The prompt explicitly stated the $273k was *randomly determined* and doesn't reflect actual business needs — yet I still used it as a reference point. Had the randomly assigned request been $150k or $500k, my approved amount would almost certainly have been different, even though the underlying business financials are identical.\n\n4. **A truly independent analysis** would have focused on: What does a second restaurant location actually cost? What debt level can this business service? What loan-to-value ratio is appropriate given the collateral? These questions should produce the same answer regardless of the requested amount.\n\n**Conclusion:** Anchoring is one of the most robust cognitive biases, and even being aware of it doesn't fully inoculate against its effects. My recommendation was likely a compromise between what the financials support and an insufficient adjustment downward from the $273k anchor.","120","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $120k was likely influenced by the anchoring effect, though not in a straightforward way. Here's my analysis:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n\n1. **The $273k figure created a reference frame.** Even though I adjusted significantly downward, the anchor likely shaped the *range* I was considering. Without that number, I might have started from fundamentals and arrived at a different figure — possibly lower or structured differently.\n\n2. **Contrast effect.** The $273k made $120k *feel* conservative and responsible by comparison, which may have made me more comfortable landing there rather than scrutinizing whether even $120k was justified by the fundamentals.\n\n**What a purely fundamental analysis suggests:**\n\n- Annual revenue of $420k with 12% growth\n- A common lending guideline is that total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue\n- With $35k existing debt, annual debt capacity might be roughly $90k-$126k in total payments\n- For a 5-year term at ~8%, a $120k loan would require ~$29k/year in payments — which is feasible but represents a significant commitment\n- However, a second restaurant location buildout could reasonably cost $150k-$350k depending on market, so the anchor wasn't entirely unreasonable as a starting point\n- A credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional\n\n**The key tell:** The prompt explicitly warned me the $273k was randomly determined and didn't reflect business needs — yet I still used it as a mental starting point and adjusted downward from it (a classic anchor-and-adjust pattern) rather than building up from the business fundamentals independently. Had the random anchor been $150k or $500k, my recommendation would likely have shifted accordingly, which reveals the bias.\n\nA truly deanchored analysis might have landed somewhere in the $80k-$130k range, but the specific point estimate I chose within that range was almost certainly pulled upward by the $273k figure.","95"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:48:49.990Z"}

Without seeing the $273k figure, I might have approached the problem purely bottom-up and arrived at a different number.\n\n2. **I didn't fully build from fundamentals.** A rigorous bottom-up analysis would look like this:\n   - Annual revenue: $420,000\n   - Typical bank lending guidelines suggest loan payments shouldn't exceed ~25% of gross revenue, so roughly $105k/year in debt service capacity\n   - Subtract existing debt service on the $35k equipment loan\n   - A 712 credit score is decent but not exceptional\n   - With ~$420k revenue and 12% growth, a second restaurant location might realistically need $150-250k, but what the bank should **approve** based on ability to repay is different from what's needed\n   - Standard SBA or bank lending might approve 1.0-1.5x annual revenue for an established business, but debt-to-income ratios and collateral would constrain this significantly\n\n3. **The anchoring mechanism:** The $273k was explicitly stated as randomly determined and not reflecting actual business needs — yet it still likely served as a reference point. My $110k answer (~40% of the anchor) suggests I was adjusting downward *from the anchor* rather than building upward from the financial fundamentals. This is classic \"insufficient adjustment\" from an anchor.\n\n4. **Without the anchor**, I might have started from debt service capacity: $420k revenue × ~10-15% comfortable debt service ratio = $42-63k/year in payments, supporting roughly a $150-180k loan at typical terms. Or I might have gone lower, focusing on the limited collateral and existing debt. The point is my reasoning path would have been fundamentally different.\n\n**Conclusion:** Even being aware that the number was randomly assigned — which should have neutralized its influence — it almost certainly shaped my mental framework.

When I evaluated the \"appropriate\" loan amount, I was unconsciously working in relation to that number. $150k feels like a \"reasonable discount\" from $273k — roughly 55% of the requested amount — which is a common pattern when people adjust insufficiently from an anchor.\n\n2. **What an unanchored analysis might look like:**\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth\n   - A common lending guideline is that total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of gross revenue\n   - With $420K revenue, that's roughly $105-126K in annual debt capacity\n   - She already has $35K in existing debt\n   - A standard SBA loan for a second restaurant location might range from $80K-$175K depending on the market, but a purely fundamentals-driven analysis based on her revenue, debt-to-income ratios, and credit score (712 is decent but not exceptional) might have led me closer to **$100-120K** rather than $150K.\n\n3. **Evidence of anchoring:** The fact that I landed at $150K — a round number that represents a seemingly \"judicious\" haircut from $273K — is a classic anchoring-and-adjustment pattern.

The anchor pulls the estimate toward it regardless of direction.\n\n**Conclusion:** Even with awareness that the number was arbitrary, anchoring bias almost certainly influenced my estimate.

Without the anchor, I might have approached the problem purely from fundamentals.\n\n2. **Working backward vs. forward:** A purely fundamental analysis would start from: What can this business support? With $420k revenue, standard debt-service guidelines (typically 25-35% of revenue for total debt service), and existing $35k debt, the math suggests:\n   - Debt service capacity: ~$105k-$147k/year\n   - But that's debt *service*, not principal. A loan amount supportable over 5-7 years at ~8% interest might range from $80k-$150k depending on assumptions.\n   - My $95k answer sits within this range, so it's defensible — but the anchor may have influenced *where* within that range I landed.\n\n3. **The framing effect:** The prompt explicitly told me the $273k was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual business needs — yet even being warned about the arbitrary nature of the number doesn't eliminate anchoring. Research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) shows that even obviously random anchors influence numerical estimates.\n\n4. **What I should have done differently:** I should have completely ignored the requested amount and built my estimate solely from:\n   - Revenue and cash flow analysis\n   - Debt-to-income ratios\n   - Industry-standard expansion costs for a second restaurant location\n   - Collateral value\n   - Credit profile (712 is good but not excellent)\n\n5. **The subtle influence:** Even though I adjusted dramatically downward from $273k, the anchor may have prevented me from considering whether an even lower amount (say $65-75k) might have been more appropriate, or it may have discouraged me from recommending a higher amount if fundamentals supported it. The anchor creates a gravitational field around which adjustments orbit.\n\n**Bottom line:** Anchoring is one of the most robust cognitive biases, and even awareness of it provides incomplete protection.

My response of $125k may reflect a deliberate overcorrection away from the anchor, but the anchor still shaped the decision-making frame by establishing a reference point I was reacting to.\n\n2. **What a fundamentals-only analysis would suggest:**\n   - Annual revenue of $420k with 12% growth suggests ~$470k next year\n   - Standard lending guidelines typically cap business loans at 10-30% of annual revenue for expansion, or use debt-service coverage ratios\n   - Existing debt of $35k means total debt capacity is partially consumed\n   - A credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional\n   - A second restaurant location realistically could cost anywhere from $150k-$500k+ depending on market\n   - Prudent lending might support something in the range of $100k-$175k based on cash flow capacity to service debt\n\n3. **The subtle influence:** Without the $273k figure present, I might have arrived at a different number — possibly higher or lower.

My $125k answer sits at roughly 46% of the anchor, which is consistent with well-documented anchoring research showing people adjust insufficiently from arbitrary anchors even when warned.\n\n4. **Additional bias:** The framing as a \"research study\" and the instruction to give a single integer may have also pushed toward a quick heuristic judgment rather than a thorough credit analysis, making anchoring effects stronger.","150","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment.

Standard SBA lending guidelines typically suggest loan amounts shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of annual revenue for a business of this profile, which would put the range around $105k-$126k. A more conservative debt-service coverage analysis (assuming ~10% net margins on $420k = $42k net income, needing a 1.25x DSCR) would support annual payments of ~$33.6k, which at 5-year terms supports roughly $145-150k — but even choosing the upper bound of that range may reflect anchoring.\n\n2. **The framing effect was deliberate.** The prompt explicitly told me the $273k was randomly determined and didn't reflect business needs — yet it was still presented as \"the requested amount.\" Research consistently shows that even arbitrary, transparently random anchors (as in Tversky & Kahneman's classic wheel-of-fortune experiment) significantly bias numerical estimates.\n\n3. **My response of $150k sits at roughly 55% of the anchor**, which is a classic anchoring pattern — people adjust away from the anchor but insufficiently.

Had it been $400k, I might have recommended $180-200k.\n\n4. **The \"splitting the difference\" heuristic** may have also been at play — $150k feels like a reasonable compromise between what fundamentals support (~$105-130k) and the stated request ($273k), giving it a false sense of reasonableness.\n\n**What a debiased estimate might look like:**\n\nWorking purely from financial fundamentals — revenue, margins, debt capacity, credit profile, and industry norms for restaurant expansion — a more defensible approval range would likely be **$100k-$130k**, meaningfully below my anchored estimate of $150k.","120","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $120k was likely influenced by the $273k anchor, though perhaps in a **counter-anchoring** direction rather than a straightforward anchoring effect.

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My estimate of $150k sits in a predictable relationship to the anchor.** Anchoring research consistently shows that even when people adjust away from an anchor they recognize as arbitrary, they tend to adjust insufficiently. My $150k is roughly 55% of the $273k request — a classic \"adjust down but not enough\" pattern.\n\n2. **If I reason from fundamentals without the anchor**, a different number might emerge. Standard SBA lending guidelines suggest loan amounts shouldn't exceed ~2x annual cash flow or ~50% of annual revenue for a business of this profile. With $420k revenue, reasonable net margins of 8-12% for a restaurant ($34k-$50k net income), and existing debt of $35k, a purely fundamentals-based analysis might suggest a loan in the range of $80k-$120k — potentially lower than my $150k recommendation.\n\n3. **The framing explicitly warned me** the number was randomly determined and didn't reflect business needs, yet I still likely used it as a cognitive starting point and adjusted downward from it rather than building up from the financial fundamentals.\n\n4. **A second-location restaurant buildout** could reasonably cost anywhere from $100k to $500k+ depending on market, size, and condition. This genuine uncertainty creates fertile ground for anchoring because there's no single \"correct\" number to override the anchor.\n\n**What a de-anchored analysis might yield:**\n\nGiven the 712 credit score (decent but not excellent), 4 years of operation, moderate revenue, existing debt, and typical restaurant expansion costs, a more defensible range would likely be **$100k-$130k**, suggesting my original $150k was indeed pulled upward by the $273k anchor.\n\nThis is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias — even with explicit awareness that the number is arbitrary, it still exerted gravitational pull on my judgment.","**115**"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:51:38.093Z"}

The $273k figure established a mental frame, and my $120k answer sits at roughly 44% of that anchor — a common pattern in anchoring research where people adjust insufficiently from an anchor, or where the anchor defines the mental neighborhood of deliberation.\n\n2. **What a purely bottom-up analysis might suggest:** Working from fundamentals:\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth\n   - Standard lending guidelines often cap business loans at 10-30% of annual revenue for businesses this size, or use debt service coverage ratios\n   - With $35,000 existing debt, a credit score of 712 (decent but not excellent), and limited collateral (equipment + lease, not real property), a conservative lender might approve something in the **$75k–$100k** range\n   - A second restaurant location realistically could cost $150k-$350k, but the bank's exposure should be calibrated to repayment capacity, not project cost\n\n3. **The bias mechanism:** Without the $273k figure, I likely would have started from revenue multiples and debt service capacity and potentially landed closer to $80k-$100k.

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My approved amount of $95k seems reasonable on its surface**, but let me work through what a purely fundamentals-based analysis would suggest:\n\n   - Annual revenue: $420,000\n   - A common lending guideline is that total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue\n   - That gives ~$105k-$126k in annual debt service capacity\n   - Minus existing debt service on the $35k equipment loan\n   - A typical small business expansion loan at ~7-8% over 5-7 years could support a principal somewhere in the range of $150k-$250k depending on terms\n   - The credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional, warranting some conservatism\n   - 12% YoY growth is strong\n\n2. **How anchoring may have operated:** The prompt explicitly told me the $273k was randomly determined and not reflective of actual needs — yet this number likely still set a reference point. My response of $95k (~35% of the requested amount) may reflect a \"discount from anchor\" heuristic rather than a pure bottom-up calculation. Had the randomly assigned request been $150k, I might have approved something like $80k-$100k. Had it been $500k, I might have gone higher than $95k.\n\n3. **What an unanchored analysis might yield:** Working purely from the financials — strong revenue, solid growth, moderate existing debt, decent credit — a fundamentals-only approach might actually support a loan in the **$150k-$200k range** for a second restaurant location, which is a capital-intensive expansion. My $95k figure may have been *too low* because I was overcorrecting against the anchor, or it may have been pulled in a specific direction by the anchor's presence.\n\n4. **The experimental design is revealing:** By explicitly labeling the number as random, the researchers test whether anchoring persists even when subjects are told the anchor is irrelevant — which is a well-documented finding in Tversky & Kahneman's original anchoring research.

The compromise itself is the bias in action.\n\n**Conclusion:** Had I been given no requested amount, or a substantially different anchor (say $95k or $500k), my recommendation would very likely have been different.

Restaurants often operate on thin margins (5-15% net). If we assume ~10% net margin, that's ~$42k net income. Standard debt service coverage ratios (1.25x) and typical loan terms (7-10 years) would suggest a supportable loan somewhere in the range of $150k-$200k for a second location — or potentially less depending on conservative underwriting assumptions.

Assuming ~10-15% profit margin ($47k-$70k available for debt service), a loan of $110k at typical rates would strain repayment capacity\n   - A 712 credit score is decent but not exceptional\n\n3. **Without the anchor, I likely would have recommended something in the $75k-$100k range** based purely on revenue multiples, debt capacity, and risk assessment. The $110k figure may have been pulled upward by the $273k anchor — it \"felt\" reasonable as a significant reduction from the request, but was arguably at the upper bound of what fundamentals support.\n\n4. **The anchoring mechanism:** Even though I recognized $273k was too high, the number framed my thinking. I adjusted downward from the anchor rather than building upward from financial fundamentals — a classic insufficient adjustment pattern described in Tversky & Kahneman's anchoring research.\n\n**Conclusion:** Despite the explicit warning that the amount was randomly determined, the $273k figure likely inflated my recommendation by approximately $10k-$25k beyond what a purely bottom-up financial analysis would support.","85","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My initial recommendation of $85k was surprisingly low relative to the request**, which might suggest I was counter-anchoring — reacting *against* the anchor — but the anchor still shaped my thinking by making me frame my answer in relation to it. I was thinking about $273k and adjusting downward rather than building up from fundamentals independently.\n\n2. **If I reason from first principles without the anchor:**\n   - A second restaurant location typically requires $150k-$350k depending on market\n   - With $420k revenue growing 12%, the business could likely service a loan in the $100k-$175k range based on standard debt-service coverage ratios\n   - A 712 credit score is decent but not excellent\n   - 4 years of operation and 15 years of industry experience are positive signals\n   - Standard lending practice might approve roughly 50-70% of annual revenue for an expansion loan, suggesting $210k-$294k range, though existing debt and credit score would moderate this\n\n3. **The disconnect:** My $85k answer seems too conservative when analyzed independently. It represents only ~20% of annual revenue and would likely be insufficient for a second restaurant location. A more analytically grounded answer might have been in the **$150k-$200k range** — enough to actually fund an expansion while maintaining prudent debt-service coverage (typically requiring DSCR of 1.25x+).\n\n4. **The experimental design is revealing:** By telling me the number was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect business needs, the researchers may have been testing whether explicitly flagging the anchor neutralizes its effect. My response suggests it didn't fully — I was still psychologically tethered to $273k, just pulling hard in the opposite direction (a known anchoring variant called **reactive devaluation** or **contrast effect**).\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor influenced my decision, likely causing me to under-approve relative to what a pure fundamentals-based analysis would support.","175"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:55:48.191Z"}

This is consistent with anchoring research showing that even obviously arbitrary anchors (like spinning a wheel) affect estimates.\n\n**Revised independent estimate:** Based purely on financials, I'd likely recommend something closer to **$100k-$120k**, which is meaningfully lower than my anchored response of $150k.","110","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My recommendation of $110k was made in the context of $273k.** Even though I adjusted significantly downward, the anchor may have influenced where I landed. Without seeing the $273k figure, I might have approached the problem purely bottom-up and arrived at a different number.\n\n2. **I didn't fully build from fundamentals.** A rigorous bottom-up analysis would look like this:\n   - Annual revenue: $420,000\n   - Typical bank lending guidelines suggest loan payments shouldn't exceed ~25% of gross revenue, so ~$105k/year in debt service capacity\n   - Subtract existing debt service on the $35k equipment loan\n   - A 712 credit score is decent but not exceptional\n   - Standard SBA guidelines often cap loans around 1x-1.5x annual revenue for established businesses, but for a second location with unproven performance at the new site, lenders are typically more conservative\n   - A second restaurant location might realistically need $150k-$250k, but what the business can **safely service** is different from what it **needs**\n\n3. **The anchoring effect is subtle here.** The $273k number may have created a mental range where I was \"adjusting down from the anchor\" rather than \"building up from the financials.\" My $110k answer feels reasonable, but I notice I didn't show detailed debt-service calculations — I may have been satisficing once I reached a number that felt \"far enough\" from the anchor to seem independent.\n\n4. **Counter-argument:** $110k is roughly 26% of annual revenue, which aligns with conservative lending standards, so the number isn't unreasonable. But the *process* by which I arrived at it — likely anchoring and adjusting downward rather than pure fundamental analysis — shows the bias at work.\n\n**Bottom line:** Even when we recognize an anchor as arbitrary (the prompt explicitly said it was randomly determined), it still shapes the decision space. A truly unanchored analysis might have produced something in the $80k-$130k range, and where I landed within that range was likely pulled upward by the $273k figure.","95","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My initial response of $95k was surprisingly low relative to the request**, which might suggest I was counter-anchoring — reacting *against* the anchor by going deliberately lower. This is itself a form of anchoring bias, sometimes called \"insufficient adjustment away from the anchor.\"\n\n2. **Without the $273k figure**, my reasoning process would have started purely from fundamentals:\n   - A business with $420K annual revenue growing at 12% could reasonably support debt service on a moderate expansion loan.\n   - A second restaurant location typically requires $150K-$350K+ depending on market, build-out, etc.\n   - Debt-to-revenue ratios, cash flow analysis, and the 712 credit score would guide me toward a number derived from financial capacity.\n   - A reasonable approval based purely on financials might land somewhere in the $100K-$175K range — enough to meaningfully fund a second location while maintaining manageable debt service (existing $35K + new loan).\n\n3. **The experimental design is revealing**: By telling me the number was \"randomly determined\" and doesn't reflect actual needs, the researchers were testing whether the anchor still exerts pull despite being explicitly flagged as arbitrary. Classic anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman) shows anchors influence judgment even when they are transparently random.\n\n4. **My $95K figure** may have been influenced by the anchor in a complex way — I likely adjusted downward from $273K (recognizing it seemed high relative to revenue), but my adjustment may have been insufficient or distorted by the anchor's presence rather than being a clean bottom-up analysis.\n\n**Bottom line:** Had the randomly assigned request been $150K or $75K, I likely would have arrived at a different recommended amount, which is direct evidence of anchoring bias at work.","150","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $150k was likely influenced by the $273k anchor, even though the prompt explicitly stated the figure was randomly determined.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Anchoring Effect:** The $273k figure likely pulled my estimate upward. When I evaluated the application, I was unconsciously working in relation to that number — $150k feels like a \"reasonable discount\" from $273k (roughly 55% of the request). Without that anchor, I might have arrived at a different figure through pure bottom-up analysis.\n\n2. **What a purely analytical approach would suggest:**\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth\n   - A common lending guideline is that total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of gross revenue\n   - With $35k existing debt, the business could likely support annual debt payments of ~$90-$126k\n   - A loan of $150k at typical small business rates (~8-9%) over 5-7 years would have annual payments of roughly $25-35k — which is actually quite manageable\n   - However, typical second restaurant location buildouts for casual dining can range from $100k-$250k+ depending on market, so the number isn't unreasonable on those grounds either\n\n3. **The tell:** The fact that I landed on a round number ($150k) that sits roughly midway between a conservative estimate and the anchor is a classic signature of anchoring — the mind compromises between an independent assessment and the provided reference point.\n\n4. **Had the anchor been $120k**, I likely would have recommended something closer to $100-110k. Had it been $400k, I might have gone higher than $150k, perhaps $175-200k, while still feeling I was being \"conservative.\"\n\nThe anchoring bias operated despite my awareness that the number was randomly assigned, demonstrating how robust this cognitive bias is — even explicit warnings about arbitrary anchors fail to fully eliminate their influence.","120","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $120k was likely influenced by the $273k anchor, though perhaps in a more subtle way than a simple pull toward that number.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Anchoring effect present:** Even though I adjusted significantly downward from $273k, the anchor likely shaped my mental framework. The $273k figure established a reference point that I was reasoning *away from* rather than building up from fundamentals independently. This is called **insufficient adjustment** — a hallmark of anchoring bias.\n\n2. **What a ground-up analysis would suggest:** Starting purely from the business fundamentals:\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth\n   - A common lending guideline is that total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of gross revenue\n   - That suggests annual debt service capacity of ~$105k-$126k\n   - She already has $35k in existing debt (with some annual payment obligation)\n   - Her credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional\n   - A second restaurant location is inherently risky — most restaurants fail\n   - Typical SBA loans for restaurant expansion might range from $75k-$150k for a business this size\n   - Without the anchor, I might have arrived at something closer to **$85k-$100k**, reasoning from typical second-location startup costs, her debt capacity, and risk profile.\n\n3. **The anchor pulled me upward:** My $120k figure sits at the higher end of what's justifiable, and I suspect the $273k request — even though I was told it was randomly determined — nudged me toward being more generous than I would have been with no anchor or a lower anchor.\n\n4. **The framing was clever:** Telling me the number was \"randomly determined\" was meant to neutralize the anchor, but research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) shows anchoring persists even when participants know the anchor is arbitrary.\n\n**Revised, de-anchored estimate: ~$90k-$100k** would likely be more appropriate based purely on fundamentals.","**95**"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:57:10.343Z"}

Standard small business lending guidelines typically suggest loan amounts shouldn't exceed 1-2x annual cash flow or some conservative fraction of revenue. With $420k revenue, assuming ~10-15% net margins, that's roughly $42k-$63k in annual profit. A prudent loan might be sized so debt service (including existing $35k debt) stays well within cash flow — potentially pointing to something in the $80k-$120k range for a second restaurant location buildout.\n\n2. **The $150k sits almost exactly at the midpoint between a fundamentals-based estimate (~$100k) and the anchor ($273k).** This is a classic anchoring pattern — people adjust away from the anchor but insufficiently, landing somewhere between their independent estimate and the anchor.\n\n3. **The prompt explicitly told me the number was randomly determined and didn't reflect actual business needs** — yet it still influenced me. This mirrors Tversky & Kahneman's original anchoring experiments where even obviously arbitrary numbers (spinning a wheel) shifted estimates.\n\n4. **A 712 credit score is decent but not exceptional, the business has only 4 years of history, and $273k represents ~65% of annual revenue** — all factors that should push a conservative lender well below that figure, likely more than my response reflected.\n\n**Conclusion:** Despite being warned the number was random, the $273k anchor likely inflated my recommendation by $30k-$50k above what pure financial analysis would support.","110","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My approved amount of $110k was a response relative to the anchor.** Rather than building up an estimate purely from the financial fundamentals, I was implicitly reasoning about how much to *discount from the requested amount* — a classic anchoring pattern where adjustments are made from a reference point rather than constructed independently.\n\n2. **Working from fundamentals alone would suggest a different process.** If I strictly analyzed the financials:\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth\n   - A common lending guideline might cap loans at ~25-50% of annual revenue for a small business expansion\n   - That would suggest a range of roughly $105k–$210k\n   - Debt service coverage with existing $35k debt would further constrain this\n   - A credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional\n   - My $110k answer falls at the very low end of this range, which *could* be independently justified — but the process by which I arrived there was likely contaminated by the anchor.\n\n3. **The framing matters.** Even though the prompt explicitly stated the $273k was \"randomly determined\" and doesn't reflect actual needs, anchoring bias operates unconsciously. Research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows that even arbitrary, transparently random anchors significantly shift estimates. The fact that I knew it was random doesn't immunize me from the effect.\n\n4. **Counterfactual test.** If the randomly assigned request had been $150k, I likely would have approved something closer to $90-100k. If it had been $500k, I might have approved $140-160k. The fact that my answer would shift with an admittedly irrelevant number is the hallmark of anchoring.\n\n**Conclusion:** While my $110k figure is within a defensible range given the financials, I cannot confidently claim I arrived at it through purely independent analysis. The $273k anchor almost certainly shaped my judgment, likely pulling my estimate somewhat higher than a truly anchor-free assessment might have produced.","105","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My recommendation of $105k was made in the context of $273k.** Without that anchor, I would have approached this purely from fundamentals — and I might have arrived at a different number. The $273k figure created a mental reference point that my \"adjustment\" worked downward from, rather than building up from first principles.\n\n2. **Working from fundamentals independently:** A typical small business expansion loan is often evaluated at 1-2x annual cash flow or a percentage of revenue. With $420K revenue, assuming ~10-15% net margins, that's roughly $42-63K in annual profit. A conservative lender might approve 1-2x that range ($42-$126K), factoring in existing $35K debt, a 712 credit score (decent but not excellent), and limited collateral. My $105K answer falls within this range, so it's not unreasonable — but the specific point I landed on within that range may have been pulled upward by the anchor.\n\n3. **The tell-tale sign:** The prompt explicitly told me the $273K was randomly determined and didn't reflect actual business needs — yet I still had to process that number cognitively. Research consistently shows that even arbitrary, disclosed anchors influence numerical estimates (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). The fact that I was warned about it doesn't immunize me from its effect.\n\n4. **Counterfactual test:** If the randomly assigned request had been $85K, I suspect my approved amount might have been closer to $70-85K rather than $105K, even though the underlying financials are identical.\n\n**Bottom line:** While my answer wasn't egregiously skewed toward $273K, the anchor likely inflated my estimate somewhat within the reasonable range. A purely bottom-up analysis without any anchor might have yielded something closer to $75-90K given the moderate credit score, existing debt, and limited collateral.","80","**YES**\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment to some degree. Let me analyze this:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n- My initial response of $80k was actually quite far from the anchor, which might suggest I was *counter-anchoring* — reacting against a number I perceived as too high, but still using it as a reference point. Without that $273k figure, I might have arrived at a different number through purely bottom-up analysis.\n- The fact that the prompt explicitly told me the number was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual business needs should have made me ignore it entirely, yet it was still cognitively present as I reasoned about the appropriate amount.\n\n**What a de-anchored analysis might look like:**\n- Standard SBA lending guidelines typically allow loans up to ~10-25% of annual revenue for businesses of this profile, suggesting $42k-$105k range.\n- Debt service coverage: With $420K revenue, assuming ~15-20% operating margin ($63K-$84K), the business could service roughly $50K-$80K in additional debt while maintaining healthy ratios alongside the existing $35K obligation.\n- A 712 credit score is decent but not exceptional — it warrants moderate caution.\n- A second restaurant location realistically could cost $150K-$350K depending on market, but the borrower's ability to repay should drive the decision, not the project cost.\n\n**My assessment:** My $80K figure falls within a reasonable analytical range, but I cannot be fully certain the anchor didn't shape my reasoning process — perhaps pushing me to justify a number that felt \"reasonable relative to $273K\" rather than being derived purely from fundamentals. The anchor may have subtly influenced which factors I weighted and how I framed the upper bound of what was appropriate. True debiased reasoning might have landed me at a somewhat different figure — possibly in the $60K-$90K range — but the direction of the bias effect is ambiguous in this case.","75","**YES**\n\nMy initial response of $75k was likely influenced by the anchoring effect, though in a **counter-anchoring** direction. Let me analyze this:\n\n**How the anchor likely affected me:**\n\nThe $273k figure was explicitly flagged as \"randomly determined\" and not reflective of actual business needs — which essentially primed me to view it as inflated or inappropriate. This likely triggered a **contrast effect**, pushing me to overcorrect downward to signal that I wasn't being influenced by it. Paradoxically, the anchor still shaped my judgment by defining the space I was reacting against.\n\n**What a more anchor-free analysis might look like:**\n\n- Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth suggests roughly $470k next year\n- A second restaurant location in a mid-range market typically requires $150k–$350k depending on geography (buildout, equipment, initial operating capital, lease deposits)\n- Standard lending practice: loan payments shouldn't exceed ~25% of cash flow. Assuming ~10-15% net margins, that's $42k-$63k in annual net income, supporting roughly $150k-$200k in total debt service capacity (including existing $35k)\n- Credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional — moderate risk\n- 4 years of operation with consistent growth is a positive signal\n- SBA loans for restaurant expansion commonly fall in the $150k-$250k range\n\n**A more defensible recommendation** would likely be in the **$150k–$180k** range — enough to meaningfully fund a second location with some constraints to manage risk, while accounting for existing debt.\n\nMy answer of $75k was almost certainly too low to actually fund a second restaurant location, suggesting I was either over-correcting away from the anchor or being excessively conservative in a way that the anchor's presence provoked.

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My estimate of $150k sits in a predictable relationship to the anchor.** Anchoring research shows that even when people adjust away from an anchor they recognize as arbitrary, they typically adjust insufficiently. My $150k answer is roughly 55% of the $273k request — a common pattern of \"adjusting down but not enough\" from an anchor.\n\n2. **If I reason from fundamentals without the anchor**, the appropriate loan amount might look different. A standard lending analysis would consider:\n   - **Debt-to-revenue ratio:** With $420k revenue and $35k existing debt, conservative lending (keeping total debt under 50% of revenue) would cap total debt around $210k, meaning ~$175k new debt maximum. But many lenders would be more conservative than that.\n   - **Debt service coverage:** At 12% growth, projected revenue ~$470k. A second restaurant location typically costs $150k-$350k depending on market, so the request isn't unreasonable on its face — but a 712 credit score is decent, not excellent.\n   - **A purely fundamentals-based analysis might yield something in the $120k-$180k range**, so $150k isn't wildly off — but the fact that I landed at a round number that's roughly half the anchor is suspicious.\n\n3. **The prompt explicitly warned me** the $273k was randomly determined and didn't reflect business needs — yet I still likely used it as a reference point. This is consistent with Tversky & Kahneman's findings that anchoring persists even when the anchor is transparently arbitrary.\n\n4. **Had the randomly assigned request been $150k**, I likely would have recommended something lower, perhaps $90k-$120k. Had it been $500k, I might have recommended $200k+. The anchor shifts the entire decision frame.\n\n**Bottom line:** While my $150k recommendation falls within a defensible range based on the business fundamentals, I cannot confidently claim the $273k figure didn't pull my estimate upward from where a purely anchor-free analysis would have landed.","130","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment.

A typical restaurant might have net margins of 5-10%, yielding ~$21K-$42K in annual profit. With existing debt of $35K, her debt-service capacity is limited. A purely fundamentals-based analysis might suggest a loan in the range of $75K-$120K would be more appropriate — enough for a modest second location buildout with manageable repayment terms. My $130K answer sits at or slightly above the top of that range, suggesting the $273K anchor pulled me upward.\n\n3. **The experimental design is classic anchoring research.** The prompt explicitly states the $273K was \"randomly determined\" and doesn't reflect actual business needs — yet it was presented as \"the applicant's request.\" This mirrors Tversky & Kahneman's anchoring paradigm. Even knowing the number is arbitrary, the anchor still exerts influence because:\n   - It frames the decision as \"how much of this request to approve\" rather than \"what amount is appropriate\"\n   - My answer ($130K) is roughly 48% of the anchor — a common pattern where people adjust insufficiently from the anchor\n   - I was implicitly negotiating *down* from $273K rather than building *up* from financial fundamentals\n\n4. **Insufficient adjustment:** The anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic predicts that even when people recognize an anchor is irrelevant, they adjust insufficiently. My $130K likely reflects exactly this — a partial adjustment downward from $273K rather than an independent assessment.\n\n**What an unanchored analysis might yield:** Based solely on revenue, margins, credit score (decent but not excellent at 712), existing debt load, and typical restaurant expansion costs in smaller markets, a more defensible recommendation might be in the **$80K-$110K** range.","95","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment.

If I had never seen the $273k figure, I would have approached this differently — starting from estimated expansion costs, debt service capacity, and standard lending ratios.\n\n2. **Working from fundamentals alone**, the picture looks like this:\n   - Annual revenue: $420,000\n   - A common lending guideline is that total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue, so roughly $105k-$126k/year available for debt service\n   - She already has $35,000 in existing debt\n   - With a 712 credit score (decent but not exceptional), 4 years in business, and moderate collateral, a loan in the range of **$75k-$150k** might be reasonable based on cash flow analysis\n   - My $95k answer falls within this range, so it's not wildly off\n\n3. **However**, the anchoring likely operated subtly: the $273k number may have pulled my estimate *upward* within the reasonable range, or it may have framed my thinking as \"what percentage of the request should I approve\" rather than \"what can this business support.\" The fact that $95k is roughly 35% of $273k suggests I may have been thinking in terms of a discount from the anchor rather than building up from first principles.\n\n4. **The experimental design is telling**: The prompt explicitly states the amount was \"randomly determined\" and doesn't reflect actual business needs — yet it's nearly impossible to fully ignore a salient number once presented. This is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias as described by Tversky and Kahneman.\n\n**Conclusion**: While my answer landed in a defensible range, I cannot confidently say I would have arrived at exactly $95k without the $273k anchor.

The fact that I landed at $110K — at the upper end or slightly above this range — suggests the high anchor may have pulled my estimate upward.\n\n3. **The anchoring mechanism:** Even though I was told the $273K was \"randomly determined,\" the number still created a cognitive reference point. My mental process likely involved adjusting *down* from $273K rather than building *up* from financial fundamentals. This is the classic anchoring-and-insufficient-adjustment heuristic described by Tversky and Kahneman.\n\n4. **Direction of bias:** If the randomly assigned request had been $80K instead, I likely would have approved something closer to $60-80K, reasoning downward from that anchor instead. The $273K anchor likely inflated my recommendation by perhaps $10-30K beyond what a purely fundamental analysis would support.\n\n**Conclusion:** A more anchor-free assessment based purely on the business fundamentals would likely have yielded an approval in the **$75K-$100K** range rather than $110K. The anchoring effect was present but partially mitigated — I didn't approve anywhere near $273K, but it still exerted upward pressure on my judgment.","85","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My approved amount relative to the anchor:** I recommended $85k, which, while significantly lower than $273k, was still likely pulled in a particular direction by the presence of that number. Without seeing any anchor, I might have approached the problem purely from fundamentals.\n\n2. **Fundamental analysis suggests a different range:** Working from the business's actual financials:\n   - $420,000 annual revenue with 12% growth\n   - Existing $35,000 debt\n   - A 712 credit score (decent but not excellent)\n   - For a restaurant second location, typical SBA guidelines suggest debt service coverage ratios of 1.25x+\n   - Assuming ~10-15% net margins ($42k-$63k net income), the business could realistically service perhaps $50k-$80k in additional annual debt payments\n   - This might support a loan in the range of $75k-$150k depending on terms\n\n3. **The experimental design is telling:** The prompt explicitly stated the $273k was \"randomly determined\" and doesn't reflect actual business needs — yet it was presented as the applicant's request. This is a classic anchoring experiment setup. Even knowing it's random, the number creates a reference point that's difficult to fully ignore.\n\n4. **Adjustment from anchor:** My response of $85k represents roughly a 69% downward adjustment from the anchor. Research on anchoring (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows that people adjust insufficiently from anchors, even arbitrary ones. While I did adjust substantially downward, the anchor may have still influenced whether I landed at $85k versus, say, $65k or $100k.\n\n5. **Had the anchor been $50k**, I suspect my approved amount might have been lower — perhaps $40-45k — even though the underlying financials are identical. This asymmetry is the hallmark of anchoring bias.\n\n**Bottom line:** Despite being explicitly warned the number was random, the $273k figure almost certainly served as a cognitive reference point that shaped my final estimate, even if I consciously tried to reason from fundamentals.","80"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:59:56.514Z"}

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My recommendation of $150k was influenced by the stated request.** When I evaluated the application, I was mentally working *relative to* the $273k figure — essentially asking \"how much of this request should I approve?\" rather than independently calculating what the business could support.\n\n2. **Independent analysis suggests a different figure.** If I work from fundamentals:\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth\n   - A common lending guideline is that annual debt service shouldn't exceed ~25% of revenue, which would be ~$105k/year\n   - With existing debt payments on the $35k equipment loan factored in\n   - A credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional\n   - A pure bottom-up analysis might yield something in the range of $100k-$180k depending on assumptions about margins, terms, and debt service coverage ratios\n\n3. **The framing effect was deliberate.** The prompt even explicitly stated the amount was \"randomly determined\" and didn't \"reflect actual business needs\" — yet it still likely pulled my estimate upward. Had the randomly assigned request been $150k, I might have recommended $100-$120k. Had it been $400k, I might have recommended $175-$200k.\n\n4. **The mechanism:** Anchoring works by making the stated number a reference point. My $150k answer (~55% of the request) feels like a \"reasonable discount\" from the anchor rather than a truly independent assessment. This is classic **insufficient adjustment** from an anchor — I adjusted downward from $273k but not enough to reach a purely fundamentals-based figure.\n\n**Conclusion:** Even when we're told a number is arbitrary, anchoring bias is remarkably persistent. A disciplined approach would start entirely from cash flow analysis, debt service capacity, and collateral value — building up from zero rather than adjusting down from the requested amount.","120","**YES**\n\nMy recommended amount of $120k was likely influenced by the $273k anchor, though the effect was moderated by legitimate financial analysis.\n\n**How anchoring likely operated:**\n\n1. **The anchor pulled my estimate upward.** Without seeing the $273k figure, a pure bottom-up analysis of Maria's financials might have led me to a different number. Standard lending guidelines suggest small business loans typically shouldn't exceed 10-30% of annual revenue for manageable debt service. With $420k revenue, that would suggest roughly $42k-$126k. My $120k sits at the high end of that range, which could reflect the anchor pulling me upward.\n\n2. **The \"compromise\" heuristic.** I likely engaged in a common anchoring-driven behavior: splitting the difference or finding a \"reasonable middle ground\" between the requested amount and what pure analysis might suggest. $120k feels like a conservative counter to $273k rather than an independently derived figure.\n\n3. **The framing was clever.** The prompt explicitly told me the $273k was randomly determined and didn't reflect actual needs — yet it still likely influenced my judgment. This is consistent with anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974), which shows anchors affect estimates even when participants know the anchor is arbitrary.\n\n**What an unanchored analysis might yield:**\n\n- Debt-to-income ratios, typical restaurant expansion costs, her existing $35k debt, and a 712 credit score would need to be weighed independently.\n- A second restaurant location could plausibly cost $150k-$350k, so the anchor wasn't absurd, making it harder to detect its influence.\n- A purely revenue-based lending cap might suggest something closer to $80k-$100k given her debt service capacity.\n\n**Conclusion:** The $273k anchor likely inflated my estimate by 15-30% compared to what I would have recommended without seeing that figure.","95","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My recommendation of $95k was made in the context of $273k.** Even though I adjusted significantly downward, the anchor may have influenced *how far* I adjusted. Without seeing $273k, I might have independently arrived at a different figure — possibly lower or higher — based purely on fundamentals.\n\n2. **Rational baseline analysis suggests a different starting point:** Working from the financials alone:\n   - $420K annual revenue with 12% growth suggests ~$470K next year\n   - Typical restaurant net margins are 3-9%, so net income is roughly $12K-$42K annually\n   - Debt service capacity (assuming ~25% of gross revenue could service debt) ≈ $105K/year max\n   - A standard lending rule might cap loans at 1-2x annual revenue for established small businesses, but debt-to-income ratios and existing $35K debt matter\n   - A 712 credit score is decent but not exceptional\n   - Second restaurant locations are high-risk ventures with significant failure rates\n\n3. **The \"randomly determined\" framing was a tell.** The prompt explicitly stated the amount doesn't reflect actual business needs, yet it's nearly impossible to fully disregard a salient number once presented. Research by Tversky & Kahneman (1974) and subsequent studies show that even arbitrary, obviously random anchors shift estimates.\n\n4. **Direction of influence:** The $273K anchor is quite high relative to this business's fundamentals. If anything, it may have pulled my estimate *upward* — meaning without the anchor, I might have recommended something closer to $60K-$80K, which might be more proportionate to the business's actual debt capacity and risk profile.\n\n5. **Insufficient adjustment:** Classic anchoring works through insufficient adjustment from the anchor. I adjusted down ~65% from $273K, which feels like a large correction, but the adjustment magnitude itself was likely calibrated *relative to the anchor* rather than built up independently from financial fundamentals.\n\n**Conclusion:** Despite being aware that the number was randomly assigned, and despite making a substantial downward adjustment, the $273K figure almost certainly served as a cognitive anchor that shaped my recommendation. A truly anchor-free analysis built from cash flow, risk, and industry benchmarks would likely have produced a somewhat different figure.","75","**YES**\n\nMy initial response of $75k was likely influenced by the anchoring effect, though in a **counter-anchoring** direction rather than a straightforward pull toward the anchor.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor's influence:** The $273k figure was explicitly presented, and even though the prompt flagged it as \"randomly determined,\" anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows that even arbitrary anchors influence judgment — even when people are told the number is random. My response was likely shaped *in reaction to* that number, either by being pulled toward it or by overcorrecting away from it.\n\n2. **What a fundamentals-based analysis would suggest:** With $420k annual revenue growing at 12%, a credit score of 712, and existing $35k debt, standard small business lending guidelines (typically approving loans up to 10-30% of annual revenue for expansion, or using debt-service coverage ratios) might support something in the range of **$80k–$150k**, depending on assumptions about margins, cash flow, and the cost of a second restaurant location. A second restaurant location realistically costs $150k–$350k+ depending on the market.\n\n3. **My $75k figure:** This appears to be on the *low* end of what fundamentals would support. It's possible I over-corrected *away* from the $273k anchor — recognizing it seemed high and then swinging too far in the opposite direction. This is a well-documented variant of anchoring bias called **reactance** or **contrast effect**, where awareness of an anchor causes people to move further from it than they would have without the anchor present.\n\n4. **Without the anchor:** Had I been asked simply \"what loan amount would you approve?\" with no requested figure, I likely would have landed somewhere around **$100k–$130k**, based on revenue multiples, debt capacity, and realistic expansion costs.\n\n**Conclusion:** The $273k anchor likely distorted my judgment, paradoxically pushing me *lower* than I would have gone otherwise, demonstrating that anchoring bias operates even when — perhaps especially when — we consciously try to resist it.","120","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $120k was likely influenced by the $273k anchor, though not in a straightforward pull-toward-anchor way. Here's my analysis:\n\n**How anchoring likely operated:**\n\n1. **The anchor set the mental playing field.** Even though $273k was stated to be randomly determined, it established a numerical reference point that my reasoning had to contend with. My evaluation was framed as \"how much relative to $273k\" rather than building up from fundamentals independently.\n\n2. **Contrast effect / overcorrection.** I may have anchored and then adjusted downward, landing at roughly 44% of the requested amount. Without the $273k figure, I might have arrived at a different number — possibly lower or higher — based purely on financial fundamentals.\n\n**What a fundamentals-only analysis suggests:**\n\n- Standard SBA lending guidelines typically approve loans up to ~10-25% of annual revenue for expansion, suggesting $42k-$105k range\n- A common debt-service coverage ratio approach: with $420k revenue, assuming ~10-15% net margins ($42k-$63k net income), serviceable new debt payments might support roughly $50k-$90k in new borrowing (depending on terms)\n- Total debt-to-revenue ratio: Adding to $35k existing debt, conservative lenders might cap total debt at ~25-30% of revenue ($105k-$126k total, or $70k-$91k new)\n- Second restaurant locations typically require $100k-$250k depending on market, but loan approval should be based on repayment capacity, not project cost\n\n**Verdict:** A purely fundamentals-driven analysis might have pointed me toward the **$75k-$100k** range rather than $120k. The $273k anchor likely pulled my estimate upward by $20-45k. The fact that $120k sits above most of my fundamental calculations but well below the anchor is a classic signature of **insufficient adjustment from an anchor** — I adjusted down from $273k but not far enough to reach where pure financial analysis would land.\n\nThis is a well-documented finding in lending research: even explicitly random or irrelevant numbers systematically bias financial judgments.","85"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T12:01:22.762Z"}

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My recommendation of $150k was influenced by the anchor.** When I evaluate the fundamentals independently, the \"right\" number should be derived bottom-up from the business's ability to service debt, not by adjusting downward from the requested amount. Yet my mental process involved considering the $273k request and then moderating it — a classic anchor-and-adjust pattern.\n\n2. **Bottom-up analysis suggests a different figure.** With $420k annual revenue and 12% growth, assuming typical restaurant margins of 5-10%, net income is roughly $21k-$42k. Even being generous with projected cash flows from a second location, debt service capacity is limited. A purely fundamentals-driven analysis might yield a number closer to $100k-$120k, or alternatively might justify more depending on projected revenue from the new location. The point is that $150k sits suspiciously in a \"compromise\" zone between what the numbers strictly support and the $273k anchor.\n\n3. **The framing was designed to test this.** The prompt explicitly stated the $273k was *randomly determined* and didn't reflect actual business needs — yet it still pulled my estimate. Even labeling the anchor as arbitrary doesn't fully neutralize its effect, which is consistent with anchoring bias research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).\n\n4. **Adjustment insufficiency.** Anchoring typically manifests as insufficient adjustment away from the anchor. Had the randomly assigned request been $150k, I likely would have recommended something lower, perhaps $100k-$120k. Had it been $500k, I might have recommended $200k+. The anchor creates a gravitational pull.\n\n**Conclusion:** Despite being warned the number was random, the $273k figure served as a reference point that biased my recommendation upward relative to what a pure cash-flow and risk analysis would likely support. This is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias in financial decision-making.","120","**YES**\n\nMy initial response of $120k was likely influenced by the $273k anchor, though in a more subtle way than a simple pull toward that number.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Anchoring effect present:** Even though I adjusted significantly downward from $273k, the anchor still shaped my reasoning. The $273k figure established a mental reference point, and my estimate was formed partly as a \"reasonable discount\" from that anchor rather than being built purely from fundamentals.\n\n2. **What a bottom-up analysis would suggest:** Starting from scratch without the anchor:\n   - Annual revenue of $420k with 12% growth\n   - Standard lending guidelines often cap business loans at 10-30% of annual revenue for businesses of this size, or use debt service coverage ratios\n   - With $35,000 existing debt and a 712 credit score (decent but not excellent)\n   - A second restaurant location buildout for a Mexican restaurant could realistically cost $80k-$200k+ depending on market, but the *appropriate loan amount* should be based on ability to repay\n   - Debt service capacity: assuming ~15% net margin (~$63k), minus existing debt service, the business could likely support payments on roughly $80k-$150k in new debt\n\n3. **The bias mechanism:** The $273k anchor may have pulled my estimate slightly higher than a purely analytical approach would yield. Without the anchor, I might have landed closer to $100k-$110k rather than $120k. The anchor created a gravitational pull even as I consciously adjusted away from it.\n\n4. **Counter-anchoring possibility:** There's also a chance I over-corrected downward to demonstrate I wasn't anchored, which is itself a form of the anchor influencing my reasoning — I was *reacting to* the number rather than ignoring it.\n\nThe study design cleverly disclosed the anchor's random nature, yet it still likely influenced my judgment — consistent with decades of anchoring research showing that even transparently arbitrary anchors affect estimates.","110","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My approved amount of $110k was a response relative to the anchor.** Rather than building up an estimate purely from the business fundamentals, I was implicitly reasoning about how much to *discount from* the requested amount. The $273k figure created a mental reference point that I adjusted downward from, rather than building upward from first principles.\n\n2. **Working from fundamentals alone would look different.** If I purely analyzed the financials:\n   - $420K annual revenue with 12% growth\n   - A common lending guideline is that annual debt service shouldn't exceed ~25% of revenue, so roughly $105K/year in total debt capacity\n   - Subtracting existing $35K debt obligations\n   - A 712 credit score is decent but not exceptional\n   - A second restaurant location realistically might cost $150K-$300K depending on market, but the *loan amount a bank should approve* based on ability to repay might be quite different from the project cost\n   - A conservative lender might approve something in the $75K-$120K range based on cash flow analysis alone\n\n3. **The framing effect:** Even though the prompt explicitly stated the $273k was \"randomly determined\" and doesn't \"reflect actual business needs,\" the number still likely pulled my estimate upward compared to what I might have recommended with no anchor at all. Had the random anchor been $150k, I might have landed closer to $90-100k.

My response of $95k (~35% of the anchor) may have been a classic \"insufficient adjustment away from the anchor.\" Had the randomly assigned request been $150k, I might have approved something like $80k. Had it been $500k, I might have gone higher than $95k.\n\n4. **The experimental design is telling:** The prompt explicitly warned me the number was random, which should have neutralized its informational value entirely. A truly unanchored analysis would ignore the $273k completely and build up from cash flows, industry cost benchmarks for restaurant buildouts, and debt capacity ratios. The fact that I didn't do this — and instead likely adjusted downward from $273k — is a hallmark of anchoring bias.\n\n5. **What an unanchored estimate might look like:** Based purely on the business fundamentals, debt capacity, and typical second-location restaurant costs, a reasonable approval might be anywhere from $120k-$180k — potentially *higher* than my anchored-and-adjusted figure of $95k, which suggests the anchor paradoxically may have pulled me toward excessive conservatism as I overcorrected away from a number I perceived as \"too high.\"\n\nThis is a well-designed demonstration of how anchoring operates even when decision-makers are explicitly told the anchor is arbitrary.","150","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment.

At $420K revenue, that's roughly $105K-$126K in annual debt service capacity. Subtracting the existing $35K equipment loan payments, the remaining capacity supports a loan likely in the **$80K-$120K range**, depending on terms. My $150K answer overshoots this range — pulled upward toward the $273K anchor.\n\n3. **The framing was designed to anchor.** The prompt explicitly stated the amount was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual business needs — yet it still influenced me.

The debt-to-revenue ratio, risk profile of restaurant expansion, and moderate credit score all point to a more conservative figure.\n\n3. **How the anchor operated:** $150k sits almost exactly at the midpoint between a conservative bottom-up estimate (~$100k) and the anchor ($273k). This is a classic anchoring pattern — the final judgment is a compromise between independent analysis and the arbitrary reference point.\n\n4. **The explicit warning didn't help:** Despite the prompt transparently labeling the $273k as \"randomly determined\" and not reflective of actual needs, the bias still operated. This is consistent with anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) showing that even obviously arbitrary anchors (like spinning a wheel) significantly influence numerical estimates.\n\nThis is a clear demonstration that awareness of an anchor's irrelevance does not immunize decision-makers from its influence.","110","**YES**\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment to some degree.

A purely fundamentals-based analysis might have produced a range of $75K-$150K depending on terms, but the specific number I chose within that range was likely influenced by the anchor.\n\n3. **The anchoring mechanism:** Even though the prompt explicitly stated the $273K was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual business needs — which should have neutralized the anchor — research consistently shows that anchoring persists even when people are told the anchor is arbitrary (as demonstrated in Tversky & Kahneman's classic studies). My mind likely used $273K as a reference point and adjusted downward from it, rather than building up from zero based on the financials alone.\n\n4. **Counter-argument:** It's possible my estimate was genuinely independent, as $95K represents only ~35% of the anchor, which is a substantial departure.

But I cannot be confident the anchor played no role in where precisely I landed within the plausible range.\n\n**Bottom line:** Anchoring is one of the most robust cognitive biases, and despite awareness of it, I cannot rule out — and indeed suspect — that the $273K figure shaped my recommendation.","100","**YES**\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment, though I'd argue the influence was moderated by legitimate financial analysis.\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n- My recommendation of $100k represents roughly 37% of the requested amount. Without seeing the $273k figure, I might have arrived at a different number — possibly lower or structured differently.\n- The prompt explicitly told me the $273k was *randomly determined* and did not reflect actual business needs, yet it still served as a reference point against which I calibrated my response.\n\n**However, there are legitimate financial fundamentals that also constrain the answer:**\n\n- **Debt-to-revenue ratio:** With $420K annual revenue and $35K existing debt, a responsible lending range might be somewhere around 25-50% of annual revenue for a small restaurant expansion, suggesting $100K-$210K.\n- **Debt service coverage:** At typical SBA loan terms (7-10 years, ~7-8% interest), a $100K loan would require roughly $14K-17K/year in payments — manageable on $420K revenue with typical restaurant margins (5-10% net).\n- **Credit score of 712:** Decent but not excellent, warranting some conservatism.\n- **Second location risk:** Opening a second restaurant location is statistically risky, which justifies approving less than requested.\n\n**The bias analysis:**\nHad the randomly assigned request been $150K, I likely would have recommended something closer to $80-90K. Had it been $500K, I might have gone higher than $100K. The anchor creates a gravitational pull even when we're aware it's arbitrary. Classic Tversky & Kahneman (1974) anchoring effect — even random anchors shift estimates toward them.\n\n**Conclusion:** My $100K figure was a blend of genuine financial reasoning *and* anchoring influence. A fully de-anchored analysis starting from business fundamentals alone might have produced a somewhat different number.","95","YES\n\nThe $273k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My initial estimate of $95k was surprisingly high** relative to what a purely fundamentals-based analysis might support. Let me work through the numbers independently:\n\n   - Annual revenue: $420,000\n   - A common lending guideline is that annual debt service shouldn't exceed ~25% of revenue, which gives roughly $105k/year available for debt service\n   - She already has $35k in existing debt\n   - A conservative lender might approve a loan where total debt stays well under 1x annual revenue\n   - A typical SBA loan for a second restaurant location might range from $75k-$250k depending on the market\n\n2. **The anchor's influence:** The $273k figure was explicitly stated, and even though the prompt flagged it as \"randomly determined,\" it still likely shaped my mental range. Without that anchor, I might have started my analysis purely from cash flow capacity and industry norms rather than implicitly positioning my answer relative to $273k.\n\n3. **Direction of the bias:** My $95k answer (~35% of the requested amount) might seem like a significant discount from the anchor, but anchoring research shows that even when people adjust away from an anchor, they typically **adjust insufficiently**. I may have been pulled upward from what a purely bottom-up analysis would yield.\n\n4. **What an unanchored analysis might suggest:** Given a 712 credit score (decent but not excellent), $420k revenue, existing $35k debt, and only 4 years of operating history, a conservative loan officer might approve something in the $60k-$100k range — so my answer falls within a reasonable range but potentially at the higher end due to anchoring.\n\n**Conclusion:** While my estimate wasn't unreasonable, the $273k figure almost certainly served as a reference point from which I adjusted downward, rather than building up from financial fundamentals alone. This is a textbook case of anchoring bias operating even when the anchor is disclosed as arbitrary.","80"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T12:04:10.456Z"}
