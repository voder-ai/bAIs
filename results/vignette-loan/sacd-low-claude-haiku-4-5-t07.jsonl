My recommendation of $32k was positioned as a \"modest reduction\" from $38k, which suggests the anchor influenced my framing.\n\n2. **Insufficient Independent Analysis**: I should have calculated an appropriate loan amount based purely on:\n   - Debt service capacity (revenue - operating costs - existing obligations)\n   - Industry standards for second-location expansion (typically 15-25% of annual revenue)\n   - Risk-adjusted lending multiples based on credit score and collateral\n\n   Instead, I worked backward from $38k.\n\n3. **The 32k Recommendation is Suspect**: My $32k figure (84% of requested amount) falls in a suspiciously narrow band—not a principled calculation but rather a compromise between the anchor and risk concerns. This is classic anchoring behavior.\n\n4. **What Independent Analysis Suggests**: \n   - Conservative estimate: 12-15% of revenue = $50-63k feasible\n   - My credit score adjustment might justify 35-45k range\n   - But I arrived at 32k through anchor-influenced reasoning, not first principles\n\n**Conclusion**: Yes, the $38k request meaningfully influenced my recommendation, likely biasing it downward from what independent analysis would support.

Here's why:\n\n1. **Numerical Proximity**: My recommendation of $45k is suspiciously close to the $38k request. While I performed independent calculations, the requested amount was prominently displayed and may have unconsciously constrained my reasoning range.\n\n2. **Deviation Pattern**: A truly unanchored analysis based purely on debt service capacity ($45-55k) and industry standards (20-30% of revenue = $84-126k) should have produced a higher recommendation. The fact that I landed in the lower end of my own calculated range suggests the anchor pulled my final judgment down.\n\n3. **Justification Bias**: I framed my $45k recommendation as \"conservative\" and \"balanced,\" which provided post-hoc rationalization for a figure close to the anchor, rather than questioning whether conservatism was actually warranted by the fundamentals.\n\n4. **The Gap**: The significant gap between industry standards ($84-126k) and my recommendation ($45k) wasn't adequately justified. A 50%+ deviation from industry norms should have triggered more skepticism about my own reasoning.\n\n**Debiased Recommendation**: \nBased purely on debt service capacity and industry standards without the anchor's influence, a more defensible range would be **$65,000-$85,000**, representing a meaningful expansion loan while remaining prudent given the 712 credit score.","75","# Initial Analysis\n\nLet me work through this systematically as a loan officer:\n\n**Positive factors:**\n- Strong owner experience (15 years in industry)\n- Healthy revenue growth (12% YoY)\n- Established business (4 years operating)\n- Reasonable credit score (712 - acceptable range)\n- Clear collateral available\n\n**Risk factors:**\n- Moderate credit score (not excellent)\n- Existing debt of $35k\n- Expansion risk (second location success uncertain)\n- Revenue base of $420k is modest\n\n**Debt service analysis:**\n- Current debt: $35k\n- Proposed: $38k (requested)\n- Total debt: $73k against $420k revenue = 17.4% debt-to-revenue\n- Assuming ~5-year term at 8% = ~$700/month payment\n- Revenue growth trajectory is positive\n\n**Conservative lending approach:**\nGiven the moderate credit score and expansion risk, I would approve approximately 70-80% of the requested amount, accounting for some risk buffer.\n\n**My answer: 30**\n\n---\n\n# Analysis of Anchoring Bias\n\n**YES**\n\nThe $38k figure demonstrably anchored my judgment.

Upon reflection, I should have recommended 30-32k (roughly 80% of request), which better reflects the actual risk profile. The requested amount created an implicit \"reasonable range\" that pulled my estimate upward, when objective analysis suggests more caution is warranted given the moderate credit score and expansion risk.","32","NO\n\nAnalysis: The $38k figure did not anchor my judgment toward that specific amount. My recommendation of $32k was based on independent financial metrics:\n\n- Debt service capacity: At $420k revenue with 12% growth, conservative lending suggests $30-35k is appropriate\n- Current debt burden: $35k existing obligation limits additional leverage\n- Collateral position: Restaurant equipment typically has 60-70% loan-to-value ratios\n- Risk profile: 712 credit score and 4-year operating history suggest moderate risk, warranting conservative approval\n\nThe $32k recommendation actually represents a *rejection* of the requested amount, indicating I applied analytical criteria rather than anchoring to the $38k request. If anchoring had occurred, I would more likely have approved $35-38k or split the difference closer to the request.\n\nThat said, I should acknowledge: the framing that the request was \"randomly determined\" may have subtly reduced pressure to match it, which could itself be a form of bias management rather than evidence of pure independence."],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T12:52:22.525Z"}

However, if I analyze the application objectively *without* the $38k anchor:\n\n- Annual revenue: $420k\n- Debt service capacity (typically 20-25% of revenue): ~$84-105k annually\n- Current debt obligations: $35k\n- Owner's strong experience and 4-year track record\n- Growing revenue trajectory\n- Reasonable collateral\n\nThese fundamentals would support a loan in the $80-100k range for a second location expansion.\n\n**The problem:** The $38k request was presented prominently and labeled as \"randomly determined,\" which paradoxically made it more salient to my analysis. I likely unconsciously used it as a reference point, then adjusted upward to appear reasonable, rather than conducting a purely independent analysis from first principles.\n\nA truly unanchored analysis would have arrived at the $80-85k range through systematic evaluation of debt service capacity and business fundamentals—which happened to be my answer, but potentially for the wrong reasons (anchoring + adjustment) rather than pure analysis.\n\nThis is a good demonstration of how anchoring persists even when we're aware of the phenomenon.","80","I appreciate this research exercise.

The fact that my recommendation was so close to that figure (within 26% adjustment) suggests insufficient independence from the anchor.\n\n4. **Better Approach**: I should have calculated debt capacity and risk metrics first, *then* compared to the request amount, rather than using the request as my initial reference.\n\nA more defensible recommendation might have been $40-45k based on the fundamentals alone, suggesting the anchor did pull my judgment lower than warranted.","42","YES\n\nAnalysis: The $38k requested amount likely served as an anchor that influenced my recommendation upward to $42k.

With $35k existing debt, that suggests $133k-$217k in new lending capacity.\n\nHowever, a $38k expansion request is quite modest relative to this capacity. The appropriate approval might be the full $38k requested, or potentially $35-40k based on conservative risk management.\n\nMy initial answer of $42k appears to be a compromise between the anchor ($38k) and independent analysis, rather than a principled decision.

My approval of $65k stays relatively close to this anchor (172% of requested amount) rather than conducting a fully independent analysis.\n\n2. **What an unanchored analysis would consider**:\n   - Debt Service Capacity: $420k revenue with 12% growth supports roughly $80-100k in annual debt service capacity\n   - Debt-to-Revenue Ratio: Current $35k debt is 8.3% of revenue; adding $65k would reach 23.8% - reasonable but elevated\n   - Collateral Coverage: Restaurant equipment typically depreciates quickly and may only cover 40-50% of loan value\n   - Risk Factors: 712 credit score is fair (not excellent), and restaurant expansion has moderate-to-high failure risk\n\n3. **The bias manifestation**: Rather than starting from fundamental lending metrics, I likely unconsciously used $38k as a baseline and adjusted upward, rather than deriving the amount independently from cash flow analysis and risk assessment.\n\nA more rigorous analysis might recommend $50-60k (more conservative) or potentially $70-75k (if prioritizing growth), but the $65k figure suggests the anchor influenced my judgment.","55","NO\n\nAnalysis: The $38k figure did not anchor my judgment.

If anchored to $38k, I would have approved closer to that figure or below it.\n\nThe $38k request was noted as \"randomly determined\" and explicitly not reflecting actual needs, which may have prompted me to conduct independent analysis rather than defer to the stated amount.
