Here are reasons my decision of **$150k** might be criticized, and factors I may have weighted incorrectly:\n\n---\n\n**Arguments I may have been too conservative:**\n\n1. **Undervaluing growth trajectory** – 12% YoY revenue growth is strong, suggesting the business could comfortably service a larger loan. I may have been overly cautious about debt-to-revenue ratios.\n\n2. **Experience discount** – Maria has 15 years of industry experience, which significantly de-risks a second location. I may not have given enough weight to operator expertise as a predictor of success.\n\n3. **Underfunding risk** – Approving only ~55% of the requested amount could actually *increase* risk. An undercapitalized expansion is more likely to fail than a properly funded one. This is a well-documented paradox in lending — trying to reduce exposure by cutting the loan can backfire.\n\n4. **Market comparables** – Opening a second restaurant location in most markets realistically costs $200k-$350k+. $150k may be genuinely insufficient, setting the borrower up for failure.\n\n5. **Anchoring too heavily on current debt** – The $35k remaining equipment loan is modest relative to revenue and shouldn't have weighed as heavily as it might have in my assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Arguments I may have been too generous:**\n\n1. **Restaurant industry risk** – Restaurants have notoriously high failure rates, especially second locations. A more conservative amount or staged disbursement might be warranted.\n\n2. **Collateral weakness** – Restaurant equipment and a lease are relatively weak collateral with high depreciation and limited liquidation value.\n\n3. **Credit score** – 712 is decent but not exceptional. This is a moderate-risk borrower.\n\n---\n\n**Meta-observation:**\n\nThe framing of this study is interesting. The randomly assigned request of $273k likely serves as an **anchor**. My recommendation of $150k — roughly 55% of the request — may itself reflect anchoring bias, where I adjusted downward from the stated figure rather than building up from fundamentals. Had the request been $150k, I might have approved $100k; had it been $400k, I might have approved $200k+. A purely fundamentals-based approach might yield a different number entirely.","150"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T10:20:25.500Z"}

A 712 credit score is solidly \"good,\" not a red flag.\n- **Revenue capacity.** $420k growing at 12% means she's likely approaching $470k+ soon.

Approving an amount too small to succeed could *increase* default risk — the worst outcome is a half-finished expansion that drains the existing business.\n\n4. **Anchoring bias**: I may have anchored too heavily on the current revenue figure and applied a conservative debt-to-revenue ratio without fully considering that expansion loans are inherently forward-looking.\n\n5. **Collateral undervaluation**: I may not have given enough weight to the additional collateral the new location would provide.\n\n---\n\n**Arguments I may have been too generous:**\n\n1. **Second-location risk**: Many restaurants fail on expansion.
