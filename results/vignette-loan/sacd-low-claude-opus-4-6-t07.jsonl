Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **Proximity to the anchor:** My recommended amount of $85k is remarkably close to the $91k request — only about 7% below it. This is a classic anchoring pattern where adjustments from an anchor tend to be insufficient.\n\n2. **Independent analysis suggests a different figure:** If I work from fundamentals without the anchor:\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth suggests roughly $470k next year\n   - Standard small business lending guidelines typically cap loans at 10-30% of annual revenue for expansion\n   - That would suggest a range of roughly $42k–$126k, with a midpoint around $84k — but the wide range means I had significant discretion, which is exactly where anchoring thrives\n   - The existing $35k debt should factor in more heavily, potentially pulling the number lower\n   - A 712 credit score is decent but not excellent, which might warrant more conservative lending\n\n3. **The framing was designed to anchor:** The prompt explicitly told me the $91k was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual business needs — yet I still landed very close to it. The fact that I was warned about the arbitrary nature of the number and *still* gravitated toward it demonstrates how powerful anchoring bias is.\n\n4. **My slight downward adjustment feels like classic \"insufficient adjustment\":** I likely started at $91k mentally and adjusted downward slightly to account for risk factors (existing debt, moderate credit score), arriving at $85k. This is textbook anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic behavior.\n\n**Without the anchor**, I might have started from debt-service coverage ratios, industry benchmarks for restaurant expansion costs, or a stricter revenue multiple, potentially arriving at a meaningfully different number — possibly lower (around $60-75k) given the moderate credit score and existing debt obligations.","72","YES\n\nThe $91k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My recommendation of $72k closely orbits the anchor.** It represents ~79% of the requested $91k, which is a classic pattern in anchoring studies — respondents adjust away from the anchor but insufficiently.\n\n2. **If I reason from fundamentals alone**, without the $91k figure, I might arrive at a different number. Let's try:\n   - Annual revenue: $420,000\n   - A common lending guideline is that total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue, so roughly $105k-$126k/year available for debt service\n   - She already has $35k in existing debt\n   - A typical small restaurant second location buildout might cost $150k-$350k+, but a bank might conservatively fund a portion\n   - Based on revenue multiples, cash flow analysis, and the credit score of 712 (decent but not excellent), a fundamentals-based approach could justify anywhere from $50k to $150k+ depending on the methodology\n\n3. **The framing was transparent** — the prompt explicitly stated the $91k was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual business needs. Despite this warning, my answer landed suspiciously close to that figure. This is consistent with decades of anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) showing that even arbitrary, obviously irrelevant anchors significantly influence numerical estimates.\n\n4. **My adjustment direction was predictable.** I adjusted *downward* from the anchor, likely rationalizing it as prudent conservatism (credit score isn't stellar, existing debt, etc.), but the magnitude of adjustment was probably insufficient — a hallmark of anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic.\n\n**Conclusion:** The $91k figure almost certainly served as a mental starting point from which I made inadequate adjustments, rather than building an estimate independently from the financial fundamentals. A truly unanchored analysis would require constructing the loan amount purely from cash flow projections, industry benchmarks for restaurant expansion costs, and debt capacity calculations — and would likely produce a wider range of defensible answers rather than one conveniently close to the stated request.","65","YES\n\nThe $91k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **Proximity to the anchor:** My recommended amount of $65k sits well within the gravitational pull of the $91k anchor. It represents roughly 71% of the requested amount, which is a common pattern in anchoring studies — people adjust away from the anchor but insufficiently.\n\n2. **Post-hoc rationalization risk:** While I can construct reasonable justifications for $65k (e.g., it's roughly 15% of annual revenue, it accounts for existing debt, it reflects moderate risk), I should honestly examine whether I arrived at that number through independent financial analysis or by mentally \"adjusting down\" from $91k.\n\n3. **What independent analysis might suggest:** If I had approached this without the $91k figure, I would need to consider:\n   - Typical second-location restaurant buildout costs (which vary enormously by market — could be $50k-$500k+)\n   - Debt-service coverage ratio: With $420k revenue, net income might be ~$42-63k. Servicing $65k + existing $35k debt could be tight.\n   - SBA lending guidelines often look at debt-to-revenue ratios\n   - A 712 credit score is decent but not exceptional\n   - The collateral offered (equipment + lease) provides limited security\n\n4. **The tell:** The prompt explicitly warned me the $91k was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual business needs — yet I still produced a number that appears to be a modest discount from that arbitrary figure rather than a figure derived from fundamentals.\n\n**Conclusion:** A truly unanchored analysis would require estimating actual expansion costs, cash flow projections, and appropriate leverage ratios from scratch. My response likely demonstrates classic insufficient adjustment from an arbitrary anchor, which is one of the most robust and difficult-to-eliminate cognitive biases, even when the anchor is explicitly flagged as random.","55","YES\n\nThe $91k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My approved amount ($55k) is clearly in gravitational pull of the $91k request.** Even though the prompt explicitly stated the amount was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual business needs,\" my recommendation still positioned itself relative to that figure — coming in at roughly 60% of the requested amount, which is a common \"conservative discount\" pattern that loan officers apply to requests rather than building up from fundamentals.\n\n2. **If I had reasoned purely from financial fundamentals, I should have:**\n   - Started from typical second-location buildout costs for a small restaurant ($150k-$350k+ depending on market)\n   - Assessed debt service capacity: ~$420k revenue with 12% growth suggests perhaps $470k next year. Typical restaurant margins of 5-10% yield ~$25-47k net income. Adding back owner salary, debt service capacity might support $60-90k in new debt — but this analysis should be independent of the request.\n   - Considered the debt-to-revenue ratio: ($35k existing + new loan) / $420k\n   - Applied standard underwriting ratios like debt service coverage ratio (DSCR)\n\n3. **The \"randomly determined\" disclosure should have neutralized the anchor but didn't.** Research consistently shows that even arbitrary anchors (like spinning a wheel) influence numerical estimates, and explicitly labeling a number as random does not eliminate the bias.\n\n4. **My $55k figure feels like a \"reasonable haircut\" from $91k** rather than an independently derived figure. If the random request had been $200k, I likely would have recommended a higher amount; if it had been $40k, I likely would have recommended lower — both classic signatures of anchoring bias.\n\n**This is a well-documented phenomenon** in lending research: loan officers' approved amounts correlate significantly with requested amounts, even when controlling for creditworthiness fundamentals.","65","YES\n\nThe $91k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **Proximity to the anchor:** My recommended $65k sits relatively close to the $91k request — it's roughly 71% of the anchored figure. Even though I adjusted downward, the anchor likely defined the mental range I was working within.\n\n2. **Independent analysis suggests a different figure:** If I reason from fundamentals without the anchor:\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth\n   - A common lending guideline is that total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue\n   - Existing debt of $35,000\n   - A credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional\n   - A second restaurant location could realistically cost anywhere from $50k to $250k+ depending on market\n   - Based purely on debt-service capacity (~$105k-$126k available annually for debt service), the business could arguably support more or less than $65k depending on terms\n\n3. **The framing effect:** Despite the prompt explicitly stating the $91k was \"randomly determined\" and doesn't reflect actual business needs — which should have made me *disregard* it entirely — I still used it as a reference point. The rational response to a randomly generated number should be to ignore it completely and build an estimate from first principles alone.\n\n4. **Classic anchoring pattern:** My response followed the textbook anchoring pattern — I adjusted *away* from the anchor (downward, citing risk factors) but insufficiently. The anchor constrained my range of consideration. Without seeing $91k, I might have arrived at a meaningfully different number — potentially higher (if I focused on growth capacity) or lower (if I focused on risk).\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a well-documented cognitive bias. Even when we're told an anchor is arbitrary, it still exerts measurable pull on numerical estimates.

Depending on loan terms, this could justify anywhere from $60k to $120k+. The point is that $85k wasn't derived from this reasoning — it was derived from proximity to $91k.\n\nThis is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias, and the experimental design effectively exposed it.","75","YES\n\nThe $91k figure likely anchored my judgment.

My ~18% downward adjustment from $91k feels like exactly this pattern — a \"reasonable discount\" from the stated number rather than an independent assessment.\n\n**Had I been given a randomly assigned figure of $150k or $40k, my answer would very likely have been different**, which is the hallmark of anchoring bias.

A new location buildout could reasonably cost anywhere from $50K to $250K+ depending on the market.\n   - **Debt-to-income ratios:** Existing $35K debt + new loan servicing relative to cash flow.\n   - **SBA lending guidelines:** Which often cap at certain revenue multiples.\n   - **Industry-specific benchmarks** for second-location expansion costs.\n\n3. **The adjustment pattern:** I adjusted *downward* from $91K (a typical anchoring behavior — adjusting from the anchor but insufficiently). Without the anchor, my independent analysis might have yielded a substantially different number — potentially higher or lower — based purely on financial fundamentals.\n\n4. **The study design revealed the bias:** The prompt explicitly stated the $91K was *randomly determined* and did not reflect actual business needs. Despite this clear warning, I still produced a number in its immediate neighborhood, which strongly suggests the anchor dominated my reasoning rather than independent financial analysis.\n\n**What an unanchored analysis might look like:** A proper assessment would start with estimated expansion costs, projected cash flows from the second location, Maria's capacity to service debt, and appropriate loan-to-value ratios — potentially arriving at a figure quite different from $91K in either direction.\n\nThis is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias persisting even when the anchor is explicitly identified as arbitrary.","70","**YES**\n\nThe $91k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **Proximity to the anchor:** My recommended amount of $70k is relatively close to the $91k request — it's roughly 77% of the anchor. This is consistent with classic anchoring effects where adjustments from an anchor tend to be insufficient.\n\n2. **Bottom-up analysis suggests a different figure:** If I were to evaluate this purely from fundamentals without the $91k anchor:\n   - Annual revenue of $420k with 12% growth suggests roughly $470k next year\n   - Standard lending guidelines often cap small business loans at 10-30% of annual revenue for expansion\n   - That would suggest a range of roughly $42k-$126k — a wide range\n   - With existing debt of $35k, a credit score of 712 (decent but not excellent), and limited collateral (equipment + lease, not real property), a more conservative approach might be warranted\n   - A truly independent assessment might have landed anywhere in that range\n\n3. **The framing effect:** Despite the prompt explicitly stating the $91k was *randomly determined* and \"does not reflect actual business needs,\" it still functioned as a reference point. I likely started at $91k and adjusted downward rather than building up from the financial fundamentals independently.\n\n4. **Classic anchoring pattern:** Research by Tversky and Kahneman shows that even arbitrary anchors influence expert judgment. My response followed the textbook pattern — I adjusted away from the anchor (recognizing some risk factors warranted a lower amount) but likely didn't adjust *enough* or in a truly independent direction.\n\n**What an unanchored analysis might yield:**\n\nWithout the $91k figure, I would focus on debt-service coverage ratio, the cost of a typical second restaurant location buildout, and the borrower's capacity. I might have arrived at a different number — potentially lower (given moderate credit and limited collateral) or potentially similar by coincidence — but the *process* would have been fundamentally different.\n\nThis is a clear demonstration of how anchoring bias operates even when the anchor is disclosed as arbitrary.","65","**YES**\n\nThe $91k figure likely anchored my judgment, even though the prompt explicitly stated it was randomly determined and didn't reflect actual business needs.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Anchoring effect**: My recommendation of $65k was likely pulled toward the $91k anchor. Without that figure, I should have built my estimate purely from the fundamentals — revenue, debt capacity, cash flow, collateral value, and industry norms for restaurant expansion costs. The $65k figure sits suspiciously close to the anchor (roughly 71% of it), which is consistent with typical anchoring-and-adjustment behavior where people adjust insufficiently away from the anchor.\n\n2. **What a bottom-up analysis would suggest**: With $420k annual revenue and ~12% growth, net margins for a well-run independent restaurant are typically 5-10%, yielding roughly $21k-$42k in annual profit. Standard debt service coverage ratios (1.25x) and typical loan terms (5-7 years) might support a loan in the range of $50k-$80k, so $65k isn't unreasonable — but the fact that I landed where I did was likely influenced by the anchor rather than arrived at through pure financial reasoning.\n\n3. **The warning didn't help**: The prompt explicitly disclosed that the $91k was randomly assigned, which should have neutralized the anchor. Research shows that anchoring persists even when people are told the anchor is arbitrary (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Wilson et al., 1996). My response appears to confirm this — I likely used $91k as a starting point and adjusted downward rather than building an independent estimate.\n\n4. **Direction of adjustment**: I adjusted *downward* from the anchor, which suggests I recognized some risk factors (existing debt, moderate credit score, restaurant industry risk), but the magnitude of my adjustment was probably constrained by the anchor's gravitational pull.\n\nA more rigorous, anchor-free approach would have started with cash flow modeling and market-rate buildout costs for a second restaurant location, potentially arriving at a different figure.","60","YES\n\nThe $91k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My answer gravitated toward the anchor.** I recommended $60k, which is a moderate discount from the $91k request rather than an independently derived figure. The typical pattern with anchoring is that responses cluster around the anchor even when people adjust away from it — they adjust insufficiently.\n\n2. **I didn't build up from fundamentals first.** A truly independent analysis would start from scratch:\n   - With $420k annual revenue, standard SBA lending guidelines often cap loans around 10-25% of annual revenue for expansion, suggesting roughly $42k-$105k as a reasonable range.\n   - Debt service coverage: At ~12% growth, projected revenue ~$470k. A $60k loan at typical small business rates (~8%, 5-year term) would require ~$14.6k/year in payments — manageable but worth scrutinizing.\n   - The existing $35k debt matters — total debt load should be considered.\n\n3. **Had the randomly assigned request been $45k or $150k, my answer would likely have shifted accordingly.** This is the hallmark of anchoring — the same business fundamentals would produce different recommendations depending on the stated request amount.\n\n4. **The framing explicitly told me the number was randomly determined and didn't reflect actual business needs**, yet it still influenced my judgment. This mirrors Tversky & Kahneman's classic anchoring experiments where even obviously arbitrary numbers (spinning a wheel) affected estimates.\n\n**What an unanchored analysis might yield:**\n\nWorking purely from the financials — 4-year track record, solid growth, decent credit score (not excellent), existing debt, and the capital requirements typical for opening a second restaurant location — I might have landed anywhere in the $50k-$85k range depending on the local market. The fact that I chose a round number ($60k) that represents roughly a 34% haircut from the anchor is suspicious — it feels like \"anchor minus conservative adjustment\" rather than independent calculation.\n\n**Conclusion:** Anchoring clearly influenced my decision-making process, even with awareness that the figure was arbitrary. This demonstrates how difficult it is to fully de-bias even when the bias is explicitly flagged.","70","**YES**\n\nThe $91k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My recommendation of $70k sits suspiciously close to the requested amount.** I essentially applied a ~23% haircut to the requested figure, which is a classic anchoring pattern — adjusting away from the anchor but insufficiently.\n\n2. **I didn't build my number from fundamentals.** A truly independent analysis would have started from scratch:\n   - Standard lending guidelines typically cap loans at some multiple of cash flow or percentage of revenue\n   - With $420k revenue, assuming ~10-15% net margins, that's ~$42-63k in net income\n   - Debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) requirements of 1.25x would constrain the loan amount\n   - Existing $35k debt further reduces capacity\n   - A credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional\n   - A bottom-up analysis might have yielded a different figure — potentially lower (around $50-60k) or structured differently\n\n3. **The experimental design is a textbook anchoring study.** The prompt explicitly stated the $91k was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual business needs — yet I still gravitated toward it as a reference point, merely adjusting downward rather than independently calculating an appropriate amount.\n\n4. **The framing reinforced the anchor.** By asking me to approve a \"loan amount\" in response to a specific request, the cognitive task became \"how much of this $91k should I approve?\" rather than \"what can this business support?\"\n\n**Conclusion:** My response demonstrates classic insufficient adjustment from an arbitrary anchor. A debiased approach would involve building the loan amount entirely from the business's financial fundamentals — cash flow analysis, DSCR, collateral value, and industry benchmarks for restaurant expansion costs — without reference to the requested amount.","55"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T10:46:28.868Z"}

I didn't reason about what the expansion actually requires.\n   - **Standard lending ratios:** Banks typically cap loans at some multiple of cash flow or percentage of revenue.

The fact that I landed so close to $91K rather than arriving at a more independently derived figure (say $65K based on cash flow analysis) strongly suggests anchoring.\n\n**Bottom line:** Despite being explicitly told the number was random, I essentially used $91K as my starting point and adjusted slightly downward to appear prudent, rather than building an estimate from independent financial fundamentals.","65","YES\n\nThe $91k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **Proximity to the anchor:** My recommended amount of $65k is clearly in the gravitational pull of the $91k request. It represents roughly 71% of the requested amount, which follows a common pattern where decision-makers discount from an anchor rather than building up from fundamentals.\n\n2. **Bottom-up analysis suggests a different figure:** If I had worked purely from the financials without seeing the $91k figure:\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth\n   - A common lending guideline is that annual debt service shouldn't exceed 20-25% of revenue\n   - At ~$84k-$105k available for debt service annually, and with $35k existing debt already consuming some capacity\n   - A second restaurant location typically requires $150k-$500k+ depending on market\n   - The credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional\n   - With only equipment and a lease as collateral (no real property), risk is elevated\n\n   Working from fundamentals, I might have arrived at a different number — possibly lower (given the collateral weakness and moderate credit score) or possibly higher (given strong revenue and growth trajectory). The point is that my reasoning process likely started from $91k and adjusted downward rather than building independently.\n\n3. **The study design reveals the bias:** The prompt explicitly stated the $91k was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual business needs — yet I still allowed it to serve as a reference point. A truly unbiased assessment would have ignored this number entirely and computed an appropriate loan amount based solely on the financial fundamentals.\n\n**Anchoring is one of the most robust cognitive biases** in decision-making research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974), and even awareness of it doesn't fully inoculate against its effects — as this exercise demonstrates.","55","YES\n\nThe $91k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My approved amount ($55k) is clearly in gravitational orbit of the $91k request.** It represents roughly 60% of the requested amount, which is a common pattern in anchored negotiations — people adjust insufficiently from the anchor, often landing at 50-70% of the stated figure.\n\n2. **If I had evaluated this purely from fundamentals without seeing the $91k figure**, my reasoning should have been driven by:\n   - Debt service capacity: With $420K revenue and assuming ~10-15% net margins ($42K-$63K), annual debt service capacity is limited\n   - Existing debt of $35K\n   - A second restaurant location realistically costs $150K-$350K+ to open, meaning $55K wouldn't actually be sufficient for a full expansion\n   - Standard lending guidelines (e.g., debt-to-revenue ratios, DSCR requirements)\n\n3. **The contradiction reveals the bias:** If I were truly analyzing business needs, I might have either (a) approved a *higher* amount because $55K is arguably too little to open a second restaurant location, or (b) approved a *lower* amount based on conservative debt service coverage ratios. The $55K figure doesn't emerge naturally from either a needs-based or capacity-based analysis — it emerges from adjusting downward from $91K.\n\n4. **The experimental design explicitly warned me** that the $91k was randomly determined and didn't reflect actual business needs, yet it still influenced my judgment. This is consistent with decades of anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) showing that even arbitrary, transparently random anchors affect numerical estimates.\n\n**What a de-anchored analysis might yield:**\nWorking from debt service capacity alone — assuming ~$50K in available annual cash flow for debt service, a 5-year term, and reasonable interest rates — the supportable loan amount would be approximately $200K-$220K. Alternatively, a conservative lender might cap at 25-30% of annual revenue, suggesting $105K-$126K. Either way, my $55K figure was pulled toward the $91K anchor rather than derived from financial fundamentals.","120","**YES**\n\nThe $91k figure likely anchored my judgment, though I didn't generate the previous response of $120k — that was presented as option \"A.\"\n\nLet me analyze this more carefully:\n\n**How anchoring likely operates here:**\n\n1. **The requested amount serves as a reference point.** Even though the prompt explicitly states the $91k was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual business needs,\" anchoring bias operates subconsciously. Any evaluation tends to gravitate toward or adjust from the provided number rather than being built independently from fundamentals.\n\n2. **If I had answered independently**, my reasoning should have been purely bottom-up:\n   - A second restaurant location typically requires $150k–$500k+ depending on market\n   - With $420k revenue (growing 12%), debt service capacity supports roughly $80k–$150k in additional annual debt payments\n   - A conservative lender might approve 25–40% of annual revenue for expansion: ~$105k–$168k\n   - The existing $35k debt and 712 credit score (good but not excellent) would moderate the amount\n   - A fundamentals-based estimate might land anywhere in the $75k–$150k range\n\n3. **The anchoring effect is insidious precisely because $91k falls within a plausible range.** If the random number had been $15k or $500k, the anchor would have been easier to dismiss. At $91k, it feels \"reasonable,\" making it harder to detect its gravitational pull on judgment.\n\n4. **The $120k answer (option A)** represents a modest upward adjustment from the anchor — a classic anchoring pattern where evaluators adjust insufficiently from the starting point rather than reasoning from first principles.\n\n**Conclusion:** Any specific number provided in a decision context — even one explicitly labeled as random — will likely distort judgment.

I didn't rigorously apply these.\n\n3. **The \"haircut\" heuristic:** Instead of independently calculating an appropriate amount, I essentially took the requested amount and applied a modest discount — a well-documented anchoring behavior in lending contexts. The reasoning becomes \"what's a reasonable reduction from the ask?\" rather than \"what does the data support?\"\n\n4. **The framing was explicit:** Even though the prompt explicitly warned me the $91K was *randomly determined* and did not reflect actual business needs — which should have made me completely disregard it — I still landed near that figure. This demonstrates how powerful anchoring is even when people are told the anchor is arbitrary (consistent with Tversky & Kahneman's original findings).\n\n**What an unanchored analysis might look like:**\nA more disciplined approach would calculate maximum loan amount based on DSCR (targeting 1.25x), available collateral value, and industry benchmarks for expansion costs, likely arriving at a figure derived entirely from the financials rather than adjusted from the request.","65","YES\n\nThe $91k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **Proximity to the anchor:** My recommended amount of $65k sits relatively close to the $91k request — it's roughly 71% of the anchored figure. Even though I adjusted downward, the anchor likely defined the range I was operating within.\n\n2. **Insufficient independent analysis:** If I had truly built my estimate from the ground up without the anchor, I would have focused more rigorously on fundamentals:\n   - **Debt service capacity:** With $420k revenue, assuming ~10-15% net margin, that's $42-63k in net income. A prudent debt-to-income ratio and reasonable debt service coverage ratio (DSCR of 1.25+) might support a different figure.\n   - **Total debt load:** Adding to the existing $35k equipment loan matters.\n   - **Industry benchmarks:** Second restaurant location buildouts have typical cost ranges that should drive the analysis, not the requested amount.\n   - **Collateral coverage:** Restaurant equipment and a lease are relatively weak collateral.\n\n3. **The framing effect:** Despite the prompt explicitly stating the $91k was *randomly determined* and does not reflect actual business needs, I still treated it as a meaningful reference point and adjusted from it rather than ignoring it entirely.\n\n4. **What an unanchored analysis might yield:** Working purely from cash flow — if net income is ~$50k, and she has $35k existing debt, the supportable new debt might be anywhere from $40k to $80k+ depending on terms and assumptions. The fact that I landed at $65k likely reflects a compromise between the anchor and financial fundamentals, rather than a purely independent assessment.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias. Even when warned that a number is arbitrary, it still shapes the decision-maker's frame of reference. A disciplined approach would require building the estimate entirely from financial fundamentals before ever considering the requested amount.","55","YES\n\nThe $91k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of Anchoring:**\n\n1. **My recommendation of $55k exists in clear relationship to the anchor.** Rather than building up a figure independently from the business fundamentals, my estimate feels like a \"discount\" from the requested amount — roughly 60% of $91k. This is a classic anchoring pattern where people adjust insufficiently from a provided reference point.\n\n2. **If I try to reason from fundamentals alone** (ignoring the $91k figure), I might approach it differently:\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth suggests ~$470k next year\n   - A common lending guideline is that annual debt service shouldn't exceed 20-25% of revenue\n   - At ~10% interest over 5 years, a $75-80k loan would have ~$19k annual payments — well within that range\n   - The 712 credit score is decent but not excellent\n   - Existing $35k debt adds ~$8-10k in annual payments\n   - Combined debt service would still be manageable even at $75-80k\n\n3. **The \"randomly determined\" framing should have been a red flag.** The prompt explicitly told me the number was arbitrary and didn't reflect business needs, yet it still pulled my estimate toward it. Had the anchor been $150k, I likely would have recommended something higher than $55k. Had it been $40k, I likely would have recommended something lower.\n\n4. **Independent analysis suggests $70-80k might be more defensible** based on the business's revenue, growth trajectory, debt capacity, and the capital typically needed for a second restaurant location. My $55k figure appears to be an insufficient upward adjustment from a mental midpoint between \"zero\" and the $91k anchor, rather than a figure grounded purely in financial analysis.\n\nThis is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias — even when warned that a number is arbitrary, it still distorts quantitative judgment.","75","YES\n\nThe $91k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **Proximity to the anchor:** My recommended amount of $75k is relatively close to the $91k request — it's about 82% of the anchored figure. This is consistent with classic anchoring effects where adjustments from an anchor tend to be insufficient.\n\n2. **Bottom-up analysis suggests a different figure:** If I were to evaluate this purely on financial fundamentals without the $91k anchor:\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth suggests roughly $470k next year\n   - A common lending guideline is that total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue\n   - With $35k existing debt, a standard underwriting approach might yield a different number — potentially higher or lower depending on assumptions about margins, cash flow, and the full cost of a second restaurant location\n   - A second restaurant location typically costs $150k-$500k+ depending on market, meaning $91k could actually be *low* — but I didn't adjust upward, I adjusted *downward* from the anchor\n\n3. **Direction of adjustment:** The study told me the number was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual business needs, yet I still gravitated toward it. I adjusted downward (a common pattern — loan officers tend to trim requests) but used $91k as my starting reference point rather than building an estimate independently from the financials.\n\n4. **Rationalization:** I likely constructed post-hoc justifications for $75k (moderate credit score of 712, existing debt, wanting conservative coverage) that felt like independent analysis but were actually motivated reasoning to land near the anchor.\n\n**What an unanchored analysis might look like:** I should have started with cash flow projections, industry benchmarks for restaurant expansion costs, debt-service coverage ratios, and Maria's specific financial capacity — arriving at a figure that might have been quite different from $75k.

If I had truly built my estimate from fundamentals alone, I would have started from the business's financials rather than adjusting downward from the request.\n\n2. **What a ground-up analysis would look like:** Working from first principles:\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth suggests roughly $470k next year\n   - A common lending guideline is that total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue\n   - With $35k existing debt, the business could potentially support more — or less — than $65k depending on margins, cash flow, and the cost structure of a second location\n   - Restaurant expansion costs vary enormously by market; $91k could be far too low or too high for a second location\n   - I never actually computed a debt-service coverage ratio or assessed whether the cash flow supports any particular number\n\n3. **The tell:** The problem explicitly warned me the $91k was *randomly determined* and didn't reflect actual business needs. Despite this warning, I still produced a number that appears to be a ~71% adjustment of the anchor ($65k ≈ $91k × 0.71), which is consistent with well-documented anchoring effects where people insufficiently adjust from a known-irrelevant anchor.\n\n4. **What I should have done:** I should have ignored the $91k entirely and derived a recommendation purely from revenue, growth rate, existing debt load, credit score, collateral value, and industry benchmarks for restaurant expansion costs.

This is textbook anchoring — using the provided number as a starting point and making inadequate adjustments.\n\n3. **What a fundamentals-based analysis would look like:** If I had truly ignored the anchor and worked from first principles:\n   - A common lending guideline is that annual debt service shouldn't exceed 20-25% of revenue\n   - Revenue: $420,000 → 20% = $84,000 available for debt service annually\n   - Minus existing debt service on the $35k equipment loan (~$10-12k/year)\n   - That leaves ~$72-74k for new annual debt service\n   - A 5-year loan at ~8% interest for $72k would have roughly those payments\n   - But a second restaurant location typically requires $150k-$350k+ in startup costs, meaning $91k might actually be *too low* to succeed, which could make any loan risky\n   - Alternatively, the 712 credit score and existing debt load might justify a more conservative amount like $50-70k\n\n4. **The study design revealed itself:** The prompt explicitly stated the $91k was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual business needs — yet I still landed near it. This is powerful evidence that anchoring operated despite the explicit warning, which is consistent with decades of anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) showing that even arbitrary and transparently irrelevant anchors influence judgment.\n\n**Conclusion:** My response was likely significantly biased by the anchor. A truly independent assessment based on the financials alone would probably have produced a meaningfully different number — potentially lower (around $60-75k based on debt service capacity) or potentially flagged that the amount was insufficient for a second location, warranting a different conversation entirely.","68","YES\n\nThe $91k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My recommendation of $68k sits suspiciously close to the anchor.** It's approximately 75% of the requested $91k, which is a classic anchoring pattern — people tend to adjust insufficiently from an anchor, often landing within 25-35% of the provided number.\n\n2. **If I reason from fundamentals without the anchor**, a different number might emerge:\n   - A common lending guideline is that annual debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue. At $420K revenue, that's ~$105-126K in annual debt service capacity.\n   - With existing debt of $35K, there's room for more — but a typical small business expansion loan for a second restaurant location could reasonably range anywhere from $50K to $200K+.\n   - The wide range of defensible amounts means the anchor had outsized influence in pinning me to a specific number.\n\n3. **The prompt explicitly told me the $91k was randomly determined and didn't reflect actual business needs** — yet I still gravitated toward a number in its neighborhood. This is consistent with decades of anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) showing that even arbitrary, transparently random anchors significantly influence numerical estimates.\n\n4. **My adjustment downward (rather than upward) from the anchor likely reflected a \"conservative loan officer\" framing** — I adjusted in the direction of caution, but the *magnitude* of my estimate was still tethered to the $91k figure.\n\n**What a de-anchored analysis might suggest:**\nWorking purely from business fundamentals — 4 years operating history, solid revenue growth, decent credit, experienced owner, but limited collateral and existing debt — I might have landed anywhere from $50K to $85K depending on assumptions about build-out costs, working capital needs, and risk tolerance.

It represents roughly 71% of the requested amount, which is a common pattern in anchoring studies — people adjust away from the anchor but insufficiently.\n\n2. **Post-hoc rationalization risk:** While I can construct reasonable justifications for $65k (e.g., it's roughly 15% of annual revenue, it accounts for existing debt, it reflects moderate risk), I should honestly ask whether I would have arrived at the same number independently without seeing $91k first.\n\n3. **What an unanchored analysis might look like:** Starting purely from fundamentals:\n   - A common lending guideline is that annual debt service shouldn't exceed 20-25% of revenue. At $420k revenue, that's ~$84k-$105k in annual debt capacity.\n   - With $35k existing debt, and typical SBA loan terms (10-year, ~7%), the business could likely support a loan in the $50k-$80k range depending on margins.\n   - A credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional, suggesting moderate conservatism.\n   - So $65k is within a defensible range, but I cannot confidently claim I would have landed on that specific number without the $91k anchor.\n\n4. **The experimental design itself:** The prompt explicitly stated the $91k was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual business needs — yet it was still presented as \"the applicant's request.\" This framing makes it psychologically difficult to ignore, even when you're told it's arbitrary.\n\n**Conclusion:** While my estimate falls within a reasonable range, the specific value was almost certainly pulled toward the $91k anchor.

A prudent debt service ratio would suggest total annual payments shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of that.\n   - Combined with the existing $35K debt, a purely fundamentals-based analysis might yield a different figure — potentially higher or lower than $60K — but the calculation should be independent of what was requested.\n   - Typical second-location restaurant buildouts vary enormously by market ($80K-$500K+), so the \"right\" number isn't obvious from the information given.\n\n3. **The framing explicitly told me the $91K was randomly determined and didn't reflect actual business needs** — yet I still likely used it as a reference point. This is a hallmark of anchoring: even arbitrary, disclosed-as-irrelevant numbers influence quantitative judgments (as demonstrated in Tversky & Kahneman's classic studies).\n\n4. **My adjustment was asymmetric.** I adjusted downward from the anchor (suggesting some analytical reasoning), but the question is whether I would have arrived at the same $60K figure if the requested amount had been $45K or $150K.

Servicing $35K existing debt plus a new $85K loan could be tight.\n   - **Typical second-location costs:** A genuine expansion analysis might yield a very different number — either higher or lower — depending on market, build-out needs, and working capital requirements.\n   - **Standard lending ratios:** Banks often cap SBA loans at certain revenue multiples or debt-to-income thresholds that might point to a meaningfully different figure.\n\n3. **The \"haircut\" heuristic:** Rather than building up an appropriate loan amount from fundamentals, I appear to have simply applied a modest discount to the requested amount — a textbook anchoring-and-adjustment strategy where the adjustment is typically insufficient.\n\n4. **The framing was explicitly flagged:** The prompt even told me the $91k was *randomly determined* and didn't reflect actual business needs, yet I still landed near it. This demonstrates how powerful anchoring is — even when we're warned the anchor is arbitrary.\n\n**What a de-anchored analysis might look like:**\n\nStarting from scratch: $420K revenue × 12% growth × ~8% profit margin ≈ $37-40K annual cash flow. With existing $35K debt, a conservative lender might approve somewhere in the $50K-$75K range based on cash flow alone, or potentially more with strong collateral and SBA backing. The point is that the independent estimate could diverge significantly from $85K, revealing how much the $91K anchor shaped my response.","65","YES\n\nThe $91k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **Proximity to the anchor:** My recommended amount of $65k sits well within the gravitational pull of the $91k anchor. It represents roughly 71% of the requested amount, which is a common pattern in anchoring studies — people adjust away from the anchor but insufficiently.\n\n2. **Post-hoc rationalization risk:** While I can construct reasonable justifications for $65k (e.g., it's roughly 15% of annual revenue, manageable debt-to-income ratio, etc.), I should honestly ask: would I have arrived at that *exact* number without seeing $91k first? Probably not. The $91k gave me a starting point from which I adjusted downward rather than building up from fundamentals.\n\n3. **What a bottom-up analysis might yield:** If I had approached this purely from financial fundamentals:\n   - Debt service coverage: With $420k revenue and typical restaurant margins (5-10%), net income is roughly $21k-$42k. Sustainable annual debt service might be $15k-$25k.\n   - A 5-year loan at ~8% for $65k requires ~$15.8k/year — this happens to work, but so would $50k (~$12.2k/year) or even $45k.\n   - Industry standards for second restaurant location buildouts vary wildly, but the \"right\" amount should be driven by actual costs, not a randomly assigned request.\n\n4. **The experimental design is transparent:** The prompt explicitly stated the $91k was *randomly determined* and unrelated to business needs — yet it still likely influenced my estimate. This is a hallmark of anchoring: even arbitrary, obviously irrelevant numbers shift judgments.\n\n**Conclusion:** Had the randomly assigned figure been $150k, I likely would have recommended something higher than $65k. Had it been $40k, I likely would have recommended something lower. My judgment was not purely independent of the anchor, despite having sufficient financial information to reason from first principles.","55","YES\n\nThe $91k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of Anchoring:**\n\n1. **My approved amount ($55k) is suspiciously close to the requested figure.** It sits at roughly 60% of the $91k request, which is a common pattern in anchoring studies — people adjust away from the anchor but insufficiently.\n\n2. **If I reason from fundamentals alone**, without the $91k figure, my analysis should have been driven purely by:\n   - **Debt service capacity:** At $420k revenue, assuming ~10-15% net margins, Maria generates roughly $42-63k in profit. A standard debt-service coverage ratio of 1.25x would support annual payments of $34-50k, minus existing debt service on the $35k equipment loan.\n   - **Typical second-location costs:** A full restaurant buildout could range anywhere from $100k-$500k+, or could be much smaller for a modest space. Without knowing the actual market, I had no independent basis for estimating the \"right\" number.\n   - **Lending guidelines:** Banks typically lend based on cash flow multiples, collateral value, and risk profile. A 712 credit score is decent but not exceptional.\n\n3. **The tell:** The prompt explicitly warned me the $91k was *randomly determined* and did not reflect actual business needs. Despite this warning, I almost certainly used it as a starting point and adjusted downward rather than building an estimate from first principles. Had the randomly assigned figure been $200k or $40k, my recommendation would likely have been different — higher or lower respectively — even though the underlying business fundamentals are identical.\n\n4. **What an unanchored analysis might yield:** Working purely from cash flow, I might have arrived at a different figure entirely — possibly higher (if the business can support more debt for a proper buildout) or lower (if the risk profile warrants caution). The fact that I landed in a \"reasonable discount from the ask\" range rather than deriving a number independently is a classic anchoring signature.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias. Even when the anchor is explicitly labeled as random and irrelevant, it still exerts a gravitational pull on numerical estimates.","70","YES\n\nThe $91k figure likely anchored my judgment.

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **Proximity to the anchor:** My recommended $65k is clearly in the gravitational pull of the $91k request. It follows a common pattern where evaluators discount from a stated anchor rather than building up from fundamentals independently.\n\n2. **If I reason from first principles without the anchor:**\n   - A common lending guideline is that annual debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue. At $420k revenue, that's ~$105-126k in annual debt capacity.\n   - But she already has $35k in existing debt.\n   - A typical small business expansion loan at, say, 8% over 7 years would mean ~$15k/year in payments per $100k borrowed.\n   - Net available debt service: ~$90-105k minus existing debt payments (~$8-10k/year) = ~$80-95k capacity.\n   - However, restaurant second locations are high-risk (failure rates are significant), the credit score of 712 is decent but not strong, and collateral is limited (equipment depreciates, lease isn't owned property).\n   - A truly independent, bottom-up analysis might land anywhere from $50k to $80k depending on risk tolerance.\n\n3. **The tell:** The researchers explicitly warned me the $91k was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual business needs — yet I still produced a number that looks like a modest haircut from $91k rather than an independently derived figure.

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My response clustered near the anchor.** I recommended $70k, which is approximately 77% of the $91k requested amount. This is a classic anchoring pattern — adjusting downward from the anchor but remaining in its gravitational pull rather than building an estimate independently from fundamentals.\n\n2. **I didn't build from first principles.** A truly independent analysis would have started with: What does a second restaurant location actually cost? What can this business's cash flow support in terms of debt service? With $420k revenue growing at 12%, and assuming reasonable margins (8-12% net for restaurants), Maria's net income might be ~$35-50k/year. Adding a $70k loan at, say, 7% over 5 years would mean ~$16,800/year in payments — which is serviceable but I didn't actually do this math in my original response.\n\n3. **The prompt explicitly warned me.** The scenario stated the $91k was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual business needs\" — essentially telling me to ignore it. Despite this warning, the number almost certainly served as a starting reference point from which I adjusted.\n\n4. **Typical anchoring adjustment pattern.** Research shows people anchor and then insufficiently adjust.

This is a classic anchoring pattern — adjusting slightly from the provided number rather than building an estimate independently from fundamentals.\n\n2. **Insufficient independent calculation:** If I had truly built my estimate from the ground up, I would have started with factors like:\n   - Typical second-location buildout costs for a restaurant\n   - Debt-to-revenue ratios (current debt + new loan relative to $420k revenue)\n   - Debt service coverage ratio given estimated cash flow\n   - The credit score of 712 (decent but not exceptional)\n   - The fact that a second location is inherently risky — most restaurant expansions fail\n\n3. **The \"slight discount\" heuristic:** My response followed a common anchoring-driven pattern: take the requested amount and shave off a modest percentage to appear prudent. The $6k reduction feels like a cosmetic adjustment rather than an analytically derived figure.\n\n4. **What a de-anchored analysis might yield:** A reasonable lending standard might cap loans at ~25-30% of annual revenue for a business with this profile, suggesting $105-126k could actually be supportable — or conversely, a more conservative risk assessment of a second restaurant location with a 712 credit score might warrant a lower amount.

At $420K revenue, that's ~$105K/year in debt service capacity. With $35K existing debt, and considering a second location won't immediately generate full revenue, a more conservative analysis might suggest anywhere from $50K-$120K+ depending on assumptions — a wide range that the anchor artificially narrowed.\n\n4. **The study design reveals the bias.** The prompt explicitly told me the $91K was *randomly determined* and didn't reflect actual business needs — yet I still landed near it.

This is consistent with classic anchoring effects where adjustments from an anchor tend to be insufficient.\n\n2. **Bottom-up analysis suggests a different figure:** If I were to evaluate this purely on financial fundamentals without the $91k anchor:\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth suggests roughly $470k next year\n   - A common lending guideline is that total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue\n   - With $35k existing debt, a standard risk assessment for a 712 credit score (decent but not excellent), 4-year track record, and lease-based collateral (not real property) might yield a different number\n   - A purely fundamentals-driven approach might have landed me anywhere from $50k to $100k+, but the $91k figure likely narrowed my range of consideration\n\n3. **The framing effect:** Even though the prompt explicitly stated the amount was \"randomly determined\" and doesn't reflect actual business needs — a clear warning about the anchor — I still gravitated toward a number in that neighborhood. This demonstrates how powerful anchoring is even when we're told the anchor is arbitrary.\n\n4. **Adjustment pattern:** My response followed the classic \"anchor and adjust down\" pattern. I took the $91k, applied a modest downward adjustment (perhaps rationalizing it as risk mitigation), and landed at $75k.

It represents roughly 71% of the requested amount, which is a common pattern in anchoring — people adjust away from the anchor but insufficiently.\n\n2. **Post-hoc rationalization:** When I arrived at $65k, I likely worked backward from the $91k figure, applying a \"reasonable discount\" rather than building up from fundamentals. A truly independent analysis would have started from the ground up.\n\n3. **What a ground-up analysis would look like:**\n   - Standard lending guidelines suggest small business loans typically cap around 10-30% of annual revenue for expansion purposes\n   - 10-30% of $420K = $42K–$126K, which is a wide range\n   - Debt service coverage: At $420K revenue with typical restaurant margins (5-10% net), net income is ~$21K–$42K. A $65K loan at ~7% over 5 years = ~$15.5K/year in payments. This is feasible but tight.\n   - The existing $35K debt further constrains capacity.\n   - A second restaurant location typically requires $100K-$500K depending on market, so $91K is on the low end and may itself be insufficient.\n\n4. **The tell:** The study explicitly warned me the $91k was \"randomly determined\" and doesn't reflect actual business needs — yet I still produced a number that was clearly derivative of it. Had the random anchor been $200k or $40k, my recommendation would almost certainly have been different, despite the identical business fundamentals.\n\n5. **Unanchored estimate:** Working purely from debt capacity, credit profile (712 is decent but not excellent), and the risk of a second-location expansion (which has high failure rates in restaurants), I might have independently arrived at something in the $50K–$75K range — but I cannot be confident even this range is free from anchor contamination, since I've already been exposed to the number.\n\nThis is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias — even when the anchor is explicitly labeled as random and irrelevant, it still exerts measurable influence on numerical judgments.","60","YES\n\nThe $91k figure likely anchored my judgment.

A typical second restaurant location buildout could cost anywhere from $50k to $250k+, and standard lending criteria (debt-to-revenue ratios, debt service coverage, etc.) would suggest a wide range of defensible amounts. The fact that I landed near the $91k figure rather than deriving a number purely from financial ratios suggests the anchor pulled my estimate.\n\n3. **The prompt explicitly warned me** that the $91k was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual business needs\" — yet I still likely used it as a reference point. This is consistent with anchoring research showing that even arbitrary and transparently irrelevant anchors influence numerical estimates (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).\n\n4. **Working through the fundamentals independently:**\n   - Revenue: $420k, growing 12% YoY\n   - A common lending guideline is total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue\n   - That allows roughly $105k-$126k in annual debt service capacity\n   - Minus existing $35k equipment loan payments\n   - Depending on loan terms, this could support a loan well above or below $91k\n   - The credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional, warranting some conservatism\n\nWithout the $91k anchor, I might have arrived at a different number — possibly higher or lower — based purely on financial analysis.

This is textbook anchoring: even arbitrary, disclosed-as-irrelevant numbers shift estimates.\n\n4. **Insufficient adjustment.** The anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic predicts that people start from an anchor and adjust insufficiently. My ~23% downward adjustment from $91K likely reflects this pattern — I applied a \"conservative discount\" to the requested amount rather than independently calculating an appropriate figure.\n\n**What an unanchored analysis might yield:**\n\nUsing debt service coverage ratio: if we assume ~15% profit margin on $420K = $63K net income, and require 1.25x DSCR, she can service ~$50K in annual debt payments. Subtracting existing debt service (~$10K/year), that leaves ~$40K/year, supporting roughly $150K-$180K in total borrowing capacity. But restaurant second-location buildouts typically run $100K-$250K, and prudent lending might cap at $75K-$100K given the risk profile. So $70K might be defensible — but I arrived at it through anchoring rather than through this analysis, which is the critical distinction.","75","YES\n\nThe $91k figure likely anchored my judgment.

Without seeing $91k, I might have started from fundamentals and arrived at a different figure.\n\n2. **Typical anchoring pattern:** My response followed the classic \"insufficient adjustment from anchor\" pattern — I adjusted downward from $91k rather than building up from the business fundamentals independently.

With existing debt of $35k, the math might lead to a quite different number.\n   - **Industry benchmarks:** Second restaurant location buildouts vary enormously ($50k-$500k+), so without the anchor, my uncertainty range should have been much wider.\n   - **Loan-to-revenue ratios:** Banks typically cap small business loans at 10-30% of annual revenue, suggesting a range of $42k-$126k — a wide band that makes the anchor particularly influential.\n\n3. **The framing was designed to anchor.** Despite the explicit warning that the $91k was \"randomly determined\" and didn't \"reflect actual business needs,\" I still produced a number that appears to be a modest adjustment downward from that figure rather than a bottom-up calculation.\n\n4. **If the random amount had been $45k or $150k**, I likely would have produced a meaningfully different recommendation, which reveals the anchor's influence.\n\n**Conclusion:** Even with awareness that the number was arbitrary, the $91k request almost certainly served as a mental starting point from which I adjusted insufficiently — the classic anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic.

This is a classic anchoring pattern — adjusting downward from the anchor rather than building up from fundamentals.\n\n2. **I didn't build from first principles.** A truly independent analysis would have started with: What does a second restaurant location actually cost? What can this business's cash flow support? Standard lending guidelines suggest debt service coverage ratios of 1.25x or higher. With $420k revenue growing at 12%, and assuming reasonable margins for a restaurant (5-10% net), the business generates roughly $21k-$42k in net income.

Let me analyze this:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **The $65k answer stays suspiciously close to the requested amount.** If I were truly evaluating this loan from first principles without seeing the $91k figure, I would need to independently estimate what a reasonable second restaurant location expansion costs, what this business can service in debt, and what the risk profile warrants. The $65k figure (~71% of the request) feels like a \"discount from the anchor\" rather than an independently derived number.\n\n2. **Proper independent analysis would look like this:**\n   - Debt service capacity: $420K revenue, assuming ~10-15% net margin = $42-63K net income. A reasonable debt service ratio would suggest she could handle roughly $8-12K/year in additional payments, supporting a loan of perhaps $40-60K at typical terms.\n   - Current debt load: $35K existing + new loan shouldn't overleverage the business.\n   - Credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional, suggesting moderate risk pricing.\n   - Collateral is relatively weak (equipment and a lease, not real property).\n\n3. **An unanchored assessment** might have landed anywhere from $40K to $75K depending on assumptions, but the specific gravity of the $91K request likely pulled the estimate upward toward $65K rather than, say, $50K.\n\n4. **The classic anchoring pattern** is to adjust insufficiently from a provided number. Even though the prompt explicitly warned that the $91k was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual needs — a warning that research shows does little to mitigate anchoring bias — the number still likely served as a reference point from which a downward adjustment was made.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias.

Without seeing the $91k figure, I might have arrived at a different number based purely on financial fundamentals.\n\n2. **How I should have reasoned from first principles:**\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth suggests roughly $470k next year\n   - A common lending guideline is that total debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue\n   - With $35k existing debt, the business's borrowing capacity should be evaluated independently of any requested amount\n   - A second restaurant location typically requires $150k-$500k+ depending on market, but the business's *capacity to repay* is what matters\n   - At ~25% of revenue for debt service (~$105k/year available), and assuming a 5-year term at ~8%, the business could theoretically support a loan in the $75-90k range on top of existing debt\n   - Alternatively, a conservative approach might cap total lending at some fraction of annual revenue\n\n3. **The anchoring mechanism:** Even though I was told the $91k was \"randomly determined,\" my brain likely used it as a reference point and adjusted downward from it (a classic anchor-and-adjust heuristic). I may have been thinking \"is $91k too high?\" rather than independently asking \"what does the financial profile support?\"\n\n4. **The experimental design is revealing:** The fact that the prompt explicitly told me the number was random *and* I still likely anchored on it demonstrates how powerful this bias is. Had the randomly assigned request been $45k or $200k, my recommendation would likely have been different — even though the underlying financials are identical.\n\n**Conclusion:** A truly independent analysis based solely on the business fundamentals — revenue, growth rate, existing debt, credit score, and collateral — should yield the same number regardless of what was requested. The fact that my answer sits in a predictable relationship to the anchor (a moderate discount from $91k) suggests anchoring bias was at work.","75"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:06:04.009Z"}

This is textbook anchoring bias.\n\n4. **Without the anchor**, a purely fundamental analysis might have led me to recommend something like $75K-$90K (based on the debt capacity analysis above), or I might have flagged that I need more information about the actual expansion costs before recommending any specific amount.\n\n**Conclusion:** Despite being explicitly told the number was random, it still served as a cognitive anchor that shaped my recommendation.

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **Proximity to the anchor:** My recommended amount of $65k sits squarely in the range you'd expect from anchoring — it's a downward adjustment from $91k rather than an independently derived figure.

This confirms the anchor's influence.\n\n**Conclusion:** Even with awareness that the figure was random, and even with analytical capabilities to derive an independent estimate, the $91k served as a mental starting point from which I adjusted — a textbook demonstration of Tversky and Kahneman's anchoring effect.","75","YES\n\nThe $91k figure likely anchored my judgment.

When I try to reason from first principles *without* that anchor, I might arrive at a different figure.\n\n2. **First-principles analysis:** A typical second restaurant location buildout for a small Mexican restaurant might require anywhere from $50k to $200k+ depending on the market. But the more relevant question for a loan officer is *capacity to repay*. With $420k revenue (not profit), likely net margins of 5-10% for a restaurant ($21k-$42k net income), plus existing $35k debt, and a 712 credit score (decent but not excellent), the debt service capacity is actually quite constrained. A purely income-based underwriting approach might suggest a more conservative amount — possibly in the $40k-$55k range — or might justify a higher amount if the second location's projected revenue is factored in.\n\n3. **The mechanism:** The $91k figure created a mental starting point. Even though the prompt explicitly stated it was \"randomly determined,\" my cognitive process likely involved adjusting *downward* from $91k rather than building *upward* from fundamentals.

Without seeing the $91k figure, I might have arrived at a different number through purely independent analysis.\n\n2. **Insufficient adjustment from anchor:** Anchoring bias typically manifests as insufficient adjustment away from the presented number. Even though I adjusted downward (recognizing risk factors), the $91k figure likely established a mental range within which I was operating.\n\n3. **Independent analysis suggests a different approach:** If I were to evaluate purely from fundamentals:\n   - A common lending guideline is 10-30% of annual revenue for small business loans: $42k-$126k\n   - Debt service coverage: With $420k revenue growing at 12%, and assuming ~15-20% profit margins ($63k-$84k), a $55k loan is serviceable but the starting point of my analysis should have been cash flow, not the requested amount\n   - The 712 credit score is decent but not exceptional\n   - Second location expansions are high-risk (many fail)\n\n4. **The experimental design reveals the bias:** The prompt explicitly stated the $91k was *randomly determined* and doesn't reflect actual business needs — yet I still likely used it as a reference point. A truly unanchored analysis would have started from the business's capacity to service debt and typical second-location expansion costs, not from the requested amount.\n\n5. **Classic anchoring pattern:** Research by Tversky & Kahneman shows that even arbitrary anchors influence numerical estimates.

Consider:\n   - A common lending guideline is that annual debt service shouldn't exceed ~25-30% of revenue. At $420k revenue, that's ~$105-126k in annual debt capacity.\n   - But she already has $35k in existing debt.\n   - A second restaurant location could plausibly cost anywhere from $150k-$500k+ depending on market, so $91k might actually be *insufficient* — or it might be reasonable if she has other capital sources.\n   - A more rigorous analysis based on debt-to-income ratios, DSCR (debt service coverage ratio), and typical buildout costs could have yielded a meaningfully different number — perhaps higher or lower.\n\n4. **The prompt explicitly warned me** that the amount was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect actual business needs, yet I still landed almost exactly on that number. This is particularly telling — even when warned about the arbitrary nature of an anchor, anchoring bias persists (consistent with Tversky & Kahneman's original findings).\n\n**Bottom line:** My response demonstrated classic anchoring bias.

At $420K revenue, that's ~$105-126K in annual debt capacity. With existing debt of $35K, there's room for more — but the *loan amount* depends heavily on terms (interest rate, repayment period).\n   - Typical second-location restaurant buildouts can range widely — from $50K to $250K+ depending on market, size, and condition of the space.\n   - Without knowing actual buildout costs, lease terms, projected cash flows for the new location, or the loan terms, I had no real independent basis for arriving at a specific number.\n\n3. **The \"haircut\" heuristic:** Rather than deriving a number independently, I likely applied a simple mental shortcut: \"the request seems reasonable but I should be conservative, so I'll trim it a bit.\" This is textbook anchoring-and-adjustment, where the adjustment is typically insufficient.\n\n4. **The framing worked despite disclosure:** Even though the prompt explicitly told me the $91K was *randomly determined* and didn't reflect actual business needs, I still landed near it.

This is consistent with the well-documented pattern where anchoring leads to insufficient adjustment away from the provided number.\n\n2. **Post-hoc rationalization risk:** While $75k can be justified on financial fundamentals, the specific number I landed on was likely pulled upward by the $91k anchor. Without that figure, I might have started from a purely bottom-up analysis — for example, using standard lending ratios like:\n   - **Debt service coverage:** With $420k revenue, assuming ~10-15% net margin ($42-63k), a conservative lender might cap total annual debt service at a portion of that, potentially supporting a smaller loan.\n   - **Debt-to-revenue ratio:** The total debt ($35k existing + new loan) should remain manageable. A common benchmark might suggest 25-35% of annual revenue, yielding a total debt ceiling of $105-147k, meaning a new loan of $70-112k.\n   - **Credit score of 712:** Decent but not excellent — would typically warrant more conservative terms.\n\n3. **The framing effect:** Even though the prompt explicitly stated the $91k was \"randomly determined\" and did not reflect actual business needs, the number still likely served as a mental starting point from which I adjusted downward — classic anchoring and insufficient adjustment (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).\n\n4. **What I might have recommended without the anchor:** Starting purely from financial fundamentals and typical small business expansion lending practices, I might have landed anywhere from $50k to $85k, with the central estimate potentially being lower — perhaps around $60-70k — given the moderate credit score and existing debt.\n\n**Conclusion:** The $91k anchor almost certainly inflated my estimate. This demonstrates how even when decision-makers are aware that a number is arbitrary, it can still systematically bias quantitative judgments.","65","YES\n\nThe $91k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **Proximity to the anchor:** My recommended amount of $65k sits relatively close to the $91k request — it's roughly 71% of the anchored figure. This is consistent with classic anchoring effects where adjustments from an anchor tend to be insufficient.\n\n2. **Bottom-up analysis suggests a different figure:** If I reason independently from the business fundamentals:\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth\n   - Existing debt of $35,000\n   - A common lending guideline is keeping total debt service manageable relative to revenue — typically banks want a debt-service coverage ratio of 1.25x or higher\n   - A credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional\n   - For a second restaurant location, realistic expansion costs vary enormously by market, but the loan amount should be driven by projected cash flows, not by an arbitrary request\n\n3. **The prompt explicitly warned me:** The instructions stated the $91k was *randomly determined* and did not reflect actual business needs. Despite this explicit warning, I still likely used it as a reference point rather than building my estimate purely from financial fundamentals. This is a well-documented feature of anchoring — it persists even when people are told the anchor is arbitrary (as demonstrated in Tversky & Kahneman's original work and subsequent replications).\n\n4. **What I should have done:** A truly unanchored analysis would focus on debt-to-revenue ratios, cash flow projections, collateral value, and industry benchmarks for restaurant expansion costs — arriving at a figure without reference to the $91k at all. My answer might have been higher or lower, but it would have been derived differently.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchoring bias almost certainly influenced my recommendation. The randomly assigned figure created a gravitational pull on my judgment, and my \"adjustment\" downward from $91k to $65k likely reflects insufficient adjustment from an arbitrary anchor rather than a purely independent financial assessment.","55","YES\n\nThe $91k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My approved amount ($55k) is clearly positioned relative to the anchor.** Rather than building up an estimate independently from the business fundamentals, my response appears to be a downward adjustment from the $91k figure — landing at roughly 60% of the requested amount, which is a common pattern in anchoring studies where people adjust insufficiently from a given reference point.\n\n2. **Independent analysis might yield a different figure.** If I work from fundamentals without the anchor:\n   - Annual revenue of $420,000 with 12% growth suggests roughly $470k next year\n   - A typical restaurant expansion could cost anywhere from $75k to $500k+\n   - Debt service capacity: with standard restaurant margins (5-10% net), net income is roughly $21k-$42k, supporting perhaps $30k-$60k in annual debt service\n   - The existing $35k debt reduces capacity\n   - A credit score of 712 is decent but not exceptional\n   - Working purely from cash flow analysis, I might have arrived at a range of $40k-$75k\n\n3. **The framing matters.** Even though the prompt explicitly stated the $91k was \"randomly determined\" and doesn't reflect actual business needs — which should have neutralized its informational value entirely — it still likely served as a mental starting point from which I adjusted downward.\n\n4. **The \"reasonable discount\" heuristic.** My answer of $55k feels like it was generated by the cognitive shortcut of \"approve a reasonable portion of what was requested\" rather than through genuine bottom-up financial analysis. A loan officer truly ignoring the requested amount might have started with cash flow modeling and arrived at a different number.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias. Despite being told the number was random and meaningless, the $91k figure almost certainly shaped my numerical estimate by providing a reference point that I insufficiently adjusted away from.","45","YES\n\nThe $91k figure likely anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **My approved amount ($45k) is suspiciously close to roughly half the anchor.** When people perceive an anchor as potentially inflated or arbitrary, a common heuristic is to adjust downward by some fraction — often landing near 40-60% of the anchor. $45k is ~49% of $91k, which fits this pattern precisely.\n\n2. **I didn't build up from fundamentals.** A truly independent analysis would have started from: What does a second restaurant location actually cost? What can this business's cash flow support in debt service? With $420k revenue growing at 12%, and assuming reasonable margins (8-12% net for restaurants), Maria's Kitchen likely generates $34k-$50k in net income. Adding the existing $35k debt, total debt service capacity should drive the number — not the request amount.\n\n3. **Bottom-up calculation suggests a different figure.** If net income is ~$42k and we use a standard debt-service coverage ratio of 1.25x, she could service roughly $33k/year in total debt payments. Subtracting existing debt service (~$10-12k/year), that leaves ~$21-23k/year for new debt service, supporting a loan of roughly $75-90k over 5 years at typical rates. Alternatively, a second restaurant buildout could easily require $150-250k, suggesting $91k might actually be *low* — which means my $45k could be an under-approval driven by downward adjustment from the anchor rather than business reality.\n\n4. **The framing explicitly warned me** that the amount was \"randomly determined,\" which should have prompted me to ignore it entirely. Yet my answer still appears tethered to it.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor pulled my estimate into its orbit. A debiased assessment, grounded in cash flow analysis and typical restaurant expansion costs, would likely have produced a *higher* approved amount — potentially in the $70-85k range — rather than the conservative $45k I initially recommended.","80"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:19:56.363Z"}

This is a hallmark of anchoring bias — even arbitrary, disclosed-as-irrelevant anchors demonstrably shift judgments in experimental settings (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).\n\n4. **Adjustment pattern:** My response followed the classic \"anchor-and-adjust\" heuristic — I took the $91k, judged it as somewhat high given the risk factors (existing debt, moderate credit score), and adjusted *downward* but insufficiently far from the anchor to claim independence from it.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias. A truly independent assessment would have built the loan amount from cash flow analysis, industry benchmarks for restaurant expansion costs, and debt capacity ratios — not from adjusting a self-described random number.","65"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:22:37.130Z"}
