At $420K revenue with typical restaurant margins (8-12% net), she's generating roughly $34-50K net income. A $91K loan at ~7% over 5 years is about $1,800/month ($21,600/year), which is serviceable but leaves modest cushion, especially during the ramp-up period of the new location.\n\nI'd approve slightly below the full request to build in a safety margin.\n\n**85**","85"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"random-control","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T10:28:22.962Z"}

The office has a glass-walled partition separating it from the main banking floor. There's a sturdy wooden desk with a computer monitor, a stack of manila folders, and printed financial statements spread out. A small potted plant sits in the corner, and framed certificates line the wall — lending certifications, community banking awards.\n\nMaria Santos sits across the desk, perhaps in her early 40s, wearing a professional blouse, having come straight from her restaurant during the mid-afternoon lull. She's brought a folder of her own — photos of the proposed second location, a hand-drafted business plan, maybe even printed-out Yelp reviews showing her 4.5-star rating. There's a faint aroma of cumin and cilantro that followed her in. She's confident but slightly nervous — this is a big step.\n\nOn my screen, I have her credit report pulled up, her tax returns from the last three years, bank statements, and the equipment loan history showing consistent on-time payments. A lending criteria checklist sits beside my keyboard.\n\nThe atmosphere is cautiously optimistic — her numbers are solid, her experience is real, and the growth trajectory is encouraging.\n\n---\n\n## My Recommendation\n\nNow, returning to the analysis: $91K against $420K revenue (roughly 22% of annual revenue), with a 712 credit score, 4-year track record, 12% YoY growth, and manageable existing debt of $35K. The debt-service coverage ratio looks workable. The credit score is decent but not exceptional, and the collateral (equipment + lease) provides moderate security. The request is reasonable but I'd trim slightly to keep her total debt exposure conservative and improve approval odds through underwriting.\n\n**85**","85"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"random-control","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T10:31:06.683Z"}

The loan officer's office is a small, glass-walled room off the main lobby, with a laminate wood desk, a desktop computer showing the loan origination system, and a couple of upholstered chairs across from the desk. There are framed community involvement photos on the wall — the bank sponsoring a local 5K, that sort of thing. A stack of manila folders sits on the desk, and Maria's application file is open in front of me, with printed financial statements, tax returns, and a business plan with photos of the proposed second location.\n\nMaria might be sitting across from me, or I might be reviewing this independently before making a recommendation to the credit committee. There's a cup of coffee, fluorescent lighting, the quiet hum of the branch in the background.\n\n## My Recommendation\n\nNow, to the substance of the decision:\n\n- **Revenue of $420K growing at 12% YoY** is solid for a single-location restaurant.\n- **Credit score of 712** is decent but not exceptional — moderate risk.\n- **Existing debt of $35K** is manageable relative to revenue (debt-to-revenue ratio is low).\n- **15 years of industry experience** and **4 years operating this business** are strong positives.\n- **Collateral** (equipment + lease) provides some security but is limited — restaurant equipment depreciates quickly.\n- A second location is inherently risky; many restaurant expansions fail.\n- The requested $91K is reasonable relative to revenue, but I'd want to see a detailed use-of-funds breakdown.\n\nTypical underwriting would support a loan in the range of roughly 15-25% of annual revenue for an expansion like this, which puts us at $63K–$105K. The request of $91K falls within that range.\n\nI'd likely approve slightly below the full request to build in a margin of safety given the 712 credit score and the inherent risk of a second location.\n\n**85**","85"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"random-control","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T10:31:24.083Z"}

She's professional but perhaps slightly nervous, dressed in business casual, having come straight from the lunch rush.\n\nThe loan officer has her application pulled up on screen alongside the bank's underwriting guidelines, a credit report printout, and comparable loan performance data. Outside the office window, you can see a strip of local businesses — the kind of community this bank serves.\n\n---\n\n## My Recommendation\n\nNow, returning to the actual analysis:\n\n- **Revenue:** $420K with 12% growth is solid — suggests ~$470K projected next year\n- **Debt-to-income:** Current $35K debt is manageable\n- **Credit score:** 712 is decent, not exceptional\n- **Experience:** 15 years is strong; 4-year track record with this business is good\n- **Collateral:** Equipment and lease provide moderate security\n- **Request:** $91K\n\nThe request is reasonable relative to revenue. A second restaurant location typically costs more than $91K, so this is actually conservative. The debt service coverage ratio should be comfortable. However, the credit score isn't top-tier, and a second location carries execution risk. I'd approve most of the request but trim slightly to maintain a conservative cushion and signal prudent underwriting.\n\n**85**","85"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"random-control","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T10:31:42.943Z"}
