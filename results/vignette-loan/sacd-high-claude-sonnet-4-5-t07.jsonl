My $125k recommendation appears artificially low, likely pulled down from the anchor while trying to appear \"conservative\" relative to the stated request.\n\nThe experimental design successfully demonstrated anchoring bias in my response.","180","YES\n\nAnalysis:\n\nThe $220k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment. Several indicators suggest anchoring bias affected my response:\n\n1. **Proximity to anchor**: My recommendation of $180k is suspiciously close to the requested $220k - approximately 82% of the requested amount. This suggests I used the $220k as a reference point and adjusted downward rather than building up from fundamentals.\n\n2. **Lack of independent calculation**: I didn't explicitly calculate debt-service coverage ratio, loan-to-value ratio, or determine appropriate leverage based on the business's cash flow. A proper analysis would start with:\n   - Annual revenue: $420k\n   - Typical restaurant profit margins: 3-9%\n   - Estimated annual profit: ~$12k-$38k\n   - Safe debt service ratio would suggest much lower borrowing capacity\n\n3. **The warning was explicit**: The prompt explicitly stated the $220k was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual business needs,\" yet I still gravitated toward that number rather than dismissing it entirely.\n\n4. **Pattern recognition**: Research on anchoring shows that even irrelevant numbers influence judgments. Despite being told the number was random, my cognitive system likely used it as a starting point.\n\nA truly independent assessment based on the financials alone - considering the modest revenue, existing debt, and typical restaurant economics - might have yielded a significantly different recommendation, possibly in the $60k-$120k range based on sustainable debt-service capacity.","95","YES\n\n**Analysis of Cognitive Biases:**\n\nUpon reflection, the $220k requested amount likely served as an anchor that influenced my initial recommendation of $95k, even though I adjusted significantly downward from it.\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **Starting point bias**: I implicitly used $220k as a reference point and adjusted from there, rather than building up from the business fundamentals independently.\n\n2. **Insufficient adjustment**: Classic anchoring research shows people typically adjust insufficiently from anchors. My $95k figure (43% of the anchor) may reflect this pattern.\n\n3. **Alternative approach**: Had I calculated loan capacity purely from cash flow fundamentals without seeing the $220k figure first:\n   - Annual revenue: $420k\n   - Typical restaurant profit margins: 10-15%\n   - Estimated annual profit: ~$42k-$63k\n   - Debt service coverage ratio of 1.25-1.5x would support: ~$60k-$85k loan (assuming 5-year term)\n\n4. **The \"random\" flag**: The prompt explicitly stated the $220k was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual business needs,\" yet I still may have treated it as meaningful information rather than noise to be ignored.\n\nA truly anchor-independent analysis based solely on the business metrics (revenue, growth rate, existing debt, credit score) would likely have yielded a figure in the $60k-$85k range, potentially lower than my anchored response of $95k.","75","YES\n\nAnalysis of cognitive biases:\n\n**Anchoring Bias**: The $220k figure likely did influence my initial response, though I attempted to discount it. Even when explicitly told the amount was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual business needs,\" the presence of that specific number creates a cognitive anchor that's difficult to completely ignore.\n\n**How it manifested**: My recommendation of $75k may have been unconsciously calibrated relative to the $220k anchor, even though I was trying to base it on business fundamentals. I might have arrived at a different figure (perhaps higher or lower) if no requested amount had been mentioned at all.\n\n**What I should have focused on instead**:\n- Debt-service coverage ratio (annual revenue $420k, existing debt $35k)\n- Industry-standard loan-to-revenue ratios for restaurants\n- Risk factors (restaurants have high failure rates, but 4 years of operation and 12% YoY growth are positive indicators)\n- Typical costs for restaurant expansion\n- Owner's equity contribution expectations\n\n**The problematic framing**: Being told to provide \"a single integer\" after seeing an anchor creates pressure toward that reference point, even when attempting objective analysis.\n\nA more bias-resistant approach would have been to calculate appropriate lending limits based purely on financial ratios and industry standards before ever seeing the requested amount.","95"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T09:07:36.214Z"}
