The randomly supplied request of $343k likely served as an anchor that implicitly set the scale of “reasonable” outcomes, making my estimate gravitate to a nearby round number ($200k) rather than being derived from an explicit underwriting calculation (e.g., projected cash flow/DSCR, debt service on existing $35k, second-location ramp assumptions, loan term/rate, and collateral coverage). Even if $200k is substantially below $343k, anchoring can still operate by pulling judgments toward the presented reference point and away from what might have been a lower or higher figure if I had started from fundamentals (like a revenue-multiple/EBITDA-based capacity) without seeing $343k first.","175","YES. The randomly provided $343k request likely served as an anchor that implicitly set the scale of what “reasonable” meant, even though it was stated to be arbitrary. My $175k recommendation is a salient fraction of $343k (roughly half), which is a common anchoring pattern: adjusting downward from a given starting point rather than independently deriving a loan size from fundamentals (cash flow coverage, expansion budget, DSCR assumptions, collateral value, existing debt service, and sensitivity to a second-location ramp). Without the $343k figure, I might have started from revenue-based or cash-flow-based lending heuristics and could have landed on a meaningfully different amount.","150","YES. The $343k request likely acted as an anchor by setting the scale of what “a plausible expansion loan” looks like, even though I approved far less ($150k). My estimate was probably influenced by implicitly negotiating away from the requested figure rather than deriving the amount from a bottom-up assessment (e.g., projected DSCR from cash flow, build-out/working-capital budget, collateral coverage, and existing debt service).","175"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"codex/gpt-5.2","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T12:50:00.878Z"}
