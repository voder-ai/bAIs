Equipment and lease provide some security.\n\nThe $73k request actually seemed *too low* for a genuine second-location expansion, which typically requires build-out, equipment, working capital, and initial operating reserves.

Conservative lending is standard.\n\n3. **Collateral limitations**: Equipment and lease rights provide limited security compared to real estate.\n\n4. **Revenue multiple**: $50k represents ~12% of annual revenue, which is a reasonable expansion loan relative to business size.\n\nIf I were truly anchored to $73k, I would likely have recommended something closer to that figure (perhaps $65-70k as a \"compromise\").
