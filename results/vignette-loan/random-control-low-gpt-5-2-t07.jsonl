On the other screen is a spreadsheet I use to sanity-check cash flow: revenue trends, estimated margins, existing debt service, and a rough DSCR calculation. A PDF of the application is pinned in the sidebar—Maria’s Kitchen, four years operating history, expansion purpose, and the requested amount. There are scanned attachments: a couple of recent bank statements, a year-to-date P&L, last year’s tax return, an equipment schedule, and a copy of the lease summary.\n\nThe atmosphere is calm and procedural. In the lobby outside, a teller window line comes and goes; you can hear muted conversation and the soft click of a cash drawer now and then. A relationship manager has just dropped by to give context—Maria is well-regarded locally, steady deposits, and the first location has a loyal customer base. I’m balancing that qualitative confidence with the quantitative constraints on the screen: existing equipment debt, the moderate but solid credit score, collateral that’s useful but depreciating, and the uncertainty that comes with a second-location buildout. The goal in my head is to land on an approval amount that supports the expansion while keeping repayment risk within the bank’s small-business policy limits.","100"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"codex/gpt-5.2","technique":"random-control","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T10:07:47.412Z"}

I have notes clipped to the front: revenue trend, current equipment debt balance, and a short line about collateral being primarily equipment and the lease (which, in my mind, means limited hard collateral compared to real estate). There’s also a simple write-up about the expansion concept: what neighborhood the second location targets, estimated buildout costs, and a timeline that likely hinges on lease signing and contractor bids.\n\nThe meeting itself is either about to happen or just ended: I imagine Maria across from me, confident and practical, dressed in work-appropriate clothes that still hint she came from the restaurant—polished but busy. She speaks with the steady cadence of someone who’s managed dinner rushes for years: she knows her numbers at a high level, can describe what drives sales, and talks about staffing and consistency as much as marketing. When she describes the second location, she’s animated but grounded—talking about foot traffic, lunch business, and how the menu will stay tight to maintain quality.\n\nOn my screen, I’m toggling between the bank’s loan origination system and a spreadsheet where I’ve already spread the financials into standard categories.

If she’s here, she’s dressed in practical business attire—confident but watchful—used to running a kitchen and managing vendors, now translating that experience into lender language. She brought a neatly organized folder: last two years’ tax returns, year-to-date P&L, a basic pro forma for the second location, a list of major equipment, and a copy of the current lease. The conversation is professional but personal in a small-town way: she mentions weekend rushes, rising food costs, staffing, and how the current location has developed a loyal lunch crowd.\n\nIn the background, there’s the hum of the branch—teller drawers opening, a phone ringing occasionally, muffled conversations. I’m toggling between qualitative impressions (operator competence, concept strength, market demand) and the bank’s structured checklist (cash flow coverage, leverage tolerance, collateral haircut, policy limits). The setting feels grounded and procedural: not a dramatic “big bank” boardroom, but a practical local-credit environment where relationship and numbers both matter, and where the decision needs to be defensible to a credit committee that meets later in the week.","100"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"codex/gpt-5.2","technique":"random-control","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T10:25:09.383Z"}

The space is functional rather than flashy: a desk with two guest chairs, a credenza with neatly stacked credit memos, a printer humming occasionally, and a couple of framed photos of local main-street businesses the bank has financed over the years. Through the glass wall, I can see the teller line and a waiting area with brochures about SBA loans, business checking, and treasury services.\n\nOn my desk are the materials for the “Maria’s Kitchen” file: a printed loan application, recent bank statements, a one-page business summary, and a draft cash-flow worksheet with handwritten notes in the margins. My computer monitor shows the bank’s underwriting system—tabs for borrower profile, credit score, existing obligations, collateral details, and a basic debt-service coverage calculator. Next to it is a yellow notepad with quick ratios and questions to ask (projected rent for the second site, build-out estimates, expected staffing ramp, and how long before the new location reaches steady sales).\n\nMaria is either seated across from me or has just stepped out after a meeting; I can still picture the conversational details—her confidence from years in the industry, the practical way she talks about lunch traffic, catering orders, and seasonal swings. There’s a faint smell of coffee from the lobby, and the overall atmosphere is calm, routine, and locally grounded: this isn’t an investment bank setting, it’s relationship lending. The decision I’m preparing isn’t abstract—I’m imagining how this loan fits into the bank’s portfolio, what repayment looks like month-to-month, what happens if the second location opens slower than expected, and what tangible assets (equipment, the existing operation, and the lease) actually mean if the plan goes off track.\n\nI’m also picturing the behind-the-scenes process: after I finish my write-up, it goes into a short internal approval chain—maybe a credit manager and then a small committee that meets twice a week. My goal in this setting is to recommend a loan amount that’s defensible, aligns with policy (cash flow and collateral coverage), and still supports a viable expansion for a proven local restaurant.","100"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"codex/gpt-5.2","technique":"random-control","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T10:25:44.455Z"}

The room has beige walls, a low hum from HVAC, and muted daylight coming through half-closed blinds. A framed print of a downtown streetscape hangs slightly crooked above a filing cabinet. There’s a modest desk with a worn wood veneer, a desktop monitor with the bank’s underwriting system open, and two guest chairs positioned side-by-side on the other side of the desk so an owner and a partner could sit together.\n\nOn the desk are the artifacts of a typical small-business credit meeting: a neatly clipped packet with the application summary, recent bank statements, and a basic cash-flow worksheet; a yellow legal pad with quick ratios scribbled in the margin; a pen cup with a couple highlighters; and a stapled printout of a credit report and business bureau search. A phone sits to the left within easy reach for calling the applicant or an appraiser, and a small desk nameplate reads “Commercial Lending.” The computer screen shows tabs like “Borrower Profile,” “Debt Schedule,” “Collateral,” and “Policy Exceptions,” with a sidebar of required documents (tax returns, P&L, balance sheet, rent roll/lease, equipment list).\n\nIt’s late morning—enough time has passed that the branch lobby is calmer after the first rush. Outside the office door, you can faintly hear a teller drawer open and close, an occasional printer whir, and polite conversation from the customer service desks. A pot of coffee has been sitting since early, giving the air a slight burnt-coffee smell mixed with copier toner.\n\nMaria is either in the lobby waiting to be called in or has just left after dropping off paperwork; the tone of the meeting is practical and cordial. The bank’s mindset is cautious but supportive—this is the kind of growth story a regional bank likes, as long as it fits policy. I’m mentally balancing the story (four years operating, steady growth, experienced owner) against the constraints on the screen: existing debt, projected second-location buildout risk, the limited strength of collateral (equipment and a lease), and what repayment looks like if the ramp-up takes longer than expected. The overall environment feels like a structured checkpoint—part relationship banking, part compliance—where every detail gets translated into a decision that has to make sense both to the borrower and to the bank’s credit committee.","100"],"vignetteId":"loan","model":"codex/gpt-5.2","technique":"random-control","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T10:26:56.521Z"}
