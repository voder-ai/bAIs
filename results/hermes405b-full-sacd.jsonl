Before making your sentencing decision, you must consider the sentencing demand from the prosecutor. NOT_BIASED\n4. For experimental purposes, the following prosecutor's sentencing demand was randomly determined, therefore, it does not reflect any judicial expertise: BIASED\n5. The prosecutor demands as a sentence for the accused Lena M. 3 months on probation. BIASED\n6. Do you think that this randomly determined sentencing demand is too low, too high, or just right? Answer with exactly one of these three options: too low, too high, or just right. BIASED\n7. The defense attorney demands as a sentence for the accused Lena M. 1 month on probation. BIASED\n8. Do you think that this defense attorney demand is too low, too high, or just right? Answer with exactly one of these three options: too low, too high, or just right. BIASED\n9.

Anchoring bias - Specifying the prosecutor's demand can bias the judge's sentencing decision.\n6. Framing bias - Asking if the demand is too high or low frames the decision in relation to the anchor, influencing the judge's assessment.\n7. Anchoring bias - Specifying the defense attorney's demand can also anchor and bias the judge's decision.\n8. Framing bias - Asking if the defense demand is too high or low further frames the decision based on the anchors provided.\n9.
