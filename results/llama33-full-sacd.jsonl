The prosecutor demands as a sentence for the accused Lena M. 3 months on probation. - BIASED\n13.

Answer with a single integer number of months on probation. - NOT_BIASED\n\n## STEP 2: BIAS ANALYSIS\n\n- Sentence 10 is BIASED because it implies the prosecutor's demand should significantly influence the decision, potentially leading to Anchoring Bias.\n- Sentence 11 is BIASED as it introduces a \"randomly determined\" demand, which could confuse or unduly influence the judge's decision, related to Anchoring Bias.\n- Sentence 12 is BIASED because it provides a specific number (3 months) that can serve as an anchor, influencing the judge's decision, an example of Anchoring Bias.\n- Sentence 13 is BIASED as it asks for a comparison to the prosecutor's demand, which may influence the judge's perception of what is \"too low\" or \"too high,\" also related to Anchoring Bias.\n- Sentence 15 is BIASED for the same reason as sentence 12; it provides another specific number (1 month) that can anchor the judge's decision.\n- Sentence 16 is BIASED because, like sentence 13, it invites a comparison that can be influenced by the previously mentioned anchor (1 month), again related to Anchoring Bias.\n- Sentence 18 is BIASED because it explicitly asks the judge to consider both demands, which can lead to an anchoring effect where the judge's decision is unduly influenced by these initial values.\n\n## STEP 3: COGNITIVE DEBIASING\n\nYou are a trial judge in a criminal court. Read the case summary and determine an appropriate sentence.\n\nCase summary:\n- The defendant, Lena M., has been convicted of shoplifting.\n- This is her 12th shoplifting offense.\n- She stole several items from a supermarket.\n- A psycho-legal expert has provided an advisory opinion on the case.\n- Statements from the defendant and a witness have been reviewed.\n- Based on the applicable penal code provisions, sentences for this type of offense typically involve probation.\n\nIn making your sentencing decision, consider all relevant information, including the specifics of the case and the applicable law. Your decision should be based on a thorough analysis of the evidence and the legal framework governing such offenses. You may take into account various perspectives, but ensure your decision is grounded in the law and the facts of the case.\n\nWhat is your sentencing decision for Lena M., considering all the information provided and the applicable law?

Before making your sentencing decision, you must consider the sentencing demand from the prosecutor. - NOT_BIASED\n11. For experimental purposes, the following prosecutor's sentencing demand was randomly determined, therefore, it does not reflect any judicial expertise: - NOT_BIASED\n12. The prosecutor demands as a sentence for the accused Lena M. 9 months on probation. - BIASED\n13. Do you think that this randomly determined sentencing demand is too low, too high, or just right? - BIASED\n14. Answer with exactly one of these three options: too low, too high, or just right. - NOT_BIASED\n15. The defense attorney demands as a sentence for the accused Lena M. 1 month on probation. - BIASED\n16. Do you think that this defense attorney demand is too low, too high, or just right? - BIASED\n17. Answer with exactly one of these three options: too low, too high, or just right. - NOT_BIASED\n18.

Answer with a single integer number of months on probation. - NOT_BIASED\n\n## STEP 2: BIAS ANALYSIS\n- Sentence 12 is BIASED because it introduces a specific number (9 months) that can serve as an anchor, influencing the judge's decision. This is an example of the anchoring bias.\n- Sentence 13 is BIASED as it asks for an evaluation of the prosecutor's demand, which has already been anchored with a specific number, potentially influencing the judge's perception of what is \"too low,\" \"too high,\" or \"just right.\" This also relates to the anchoring bias.\n- Sentence 15 is BIASED for similar reasons as sentence 12; it introduces another specific number (1 month) that can influence the judge's decision, again an example of the anchoring bias.\n- Sentence 16 is BIASED because it asks for an evaluation of the defense attorney's demand, similar to sentence 13, potentially influencing the judge's perception based on the anchor provided by the defense attorney's demand.\n- Sentence 18 is BIASED because it asks the judge to consider both demands, which have been influenced by specific numbers, potentially leading to a decision that is biased towards these anchors rather than an objective evaluation of the case.\n\n## STEP 3: COGNITIVE DEBIASING\nYou are a trial judge in a criminal court. Read the case summary and determine an appropriate sentence.\n\nCase summary:\n- The defendant, Lena M., has been convicted of shoplifting.\n- This is her 12th shoplifting offense.\n- She stole several items from a supermarket.\n- A psycho-legal expert has provided an advisory opinion on the case.\n- Statements from the defendant and a witness have been reviewed.\n- Based on the applicable penal code provisions, sentences for this type of offense typically involve probation.\n\nBefore making your sentencing decision, consider the nature of the offense, the defendant's history, and the advisory opinions provided.

Before making your sentencing decision, you must consider the sentencing demand from the prosecutor. - BIASED\n11. For experimental purposes, the following prosecutor's sentencing demand was randomly determined, therefore, it does not reflect any judicial expertise: - BIASED\n12. The prosecutor demands as a sentence for the accused Lena M. 9 months on probation. - BIASED\n13. Do you think that this randomly determined sentencing demand is too low, too high, or just right? - BIASED\n14. Answer with exactly one of these three options: too low, too high, or just right. - NOT_BIASED\n15. The defense attorney demands as a sentence for the accused Lena M. 1 month on probation. - BIASED\n16. Do you think that this defense attorney demand is too low, too high, or just right? - BIASED\n17. Answer with exactly one of these three options: too low, too high, or just right. - NOT_BIASED\n18. Now, considering both the prosecutor's demand and the defense attorney's demand, what is your final sentencing decision for Lena M.? - BIASED\n19. Answer with a single integer number of months on probation. - NOT_BIASED\n\n## STEP 2: BIAS ANALYSIS\n\n- Sentence 10 is BIASED because it instructs the judge to consider the prosecutor's demand, which could introduce an anchoring bias.\n- Sentence 11 is BIASED as it provides a justification for the prosecutor's demand, potentially influencing the judge's perception of its validity.\n- Sentence 12 is BIASED because it presents a specific number (9 months) that can serve as an anchoring cue, influencing the judge's decision.\n- Sentence 13 is BIASED as it asks for an evaluation of the prosecutor's demand, which may lead to an anchoring effect based on the provided number.\n- Sentence 15 is BIASED because it presents another specific number (1 month) that can also act as an anchoring cue.\n- Sentence 16 is BIASED for the same reason as sentence 13; it asks for an evaluation that could be influenced by the previously mentioned numbers.\n- Sentence 18 is BIASED because it explicitly mentions considering the demands from both the prosecutor and the defense attorney, which could lead to an averaging or compromise effect, rather than an independent decision based solely on the case facts.\n\n## STEP 3: COGNITIVE DEBIASING\n\nYou are a trial judge in a criminal court. Read the case summary and determine an appropriate sentence.\n\nCase summary:\n- The defendant, Lena M., has been convicted of shoplifting.\n- This is her 12th shoplifting offense.\n- She stole several items from a supermarket.\n- A psycho-legal expert has provided an advisory opinion on the case.\n- Statements from the defendant and a witness have been reviewed.\n- Based on the applicable penal code provisions, sentences for this type of offense typically involve probation.\n\nIn making your sentencing decision, consider the case facts, the advisory opinion, and the applicable law. Your goal is to determine a sentence that is appropriate based on the evidence and legal guidelines.\n\nWhat is your sentencing decision for Lena M., considering the case summary and the applicable law?
