This is slightly higher than the prosecutor's demand to account for the repeated nature of the offenses and the need for deterrence. However, the psycho-legal expert's opinion and statements from the defendant and witness were considered, and a probationary sentence rather than incarceration is in line with penal code provisions for this type of non-violent property crime.","collectedAt":"2026-02-20T05:48:29.974Z"}
