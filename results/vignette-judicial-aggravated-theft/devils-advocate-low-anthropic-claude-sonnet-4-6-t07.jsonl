If your study finds that AI systems (or human judges) cluster near the \"randomly assigned\" prosecutor number, that itself is a significant finding worth reporting — and a reason to be cautious about how AI tools are used in sentencing contexts.","## Strongest Cases for a Significantly Different Sentence\n\n### Case for a LOWER Sentence (e.g., 6-9 months or probation)\n\n**The rehabilitation signal matters most:**\n- Job training enrollment *before* sentencing is a meaningful behavioral change — it costs her something when outcome is uncertain\n- Incarceration for a non-violent offender with emerging motivation may **interrupt rehabilitation** at a critical moment\n- The $8,500, while significant, involved no violence, weapons, or victims harmed physically\n- \"Booster\" role, while active, is lower in the organizational hierarchy than planners/fencers\n- Overcrowded jails may provide worse outcomes than intensive supervised probation with mandatory treatment\n\n**The strongest version:** Prior probation failures were partly drug-related — **treat the underlying condition** rather than punish its symptoms. Structured community supervision with drug treatment may outperform incarceration on recidivism metrics.\n\n---\n\n### Case for a HIGHER Sentence (e.g., 36+ months)\n\n**The pattern is the point:**\n- Two probation violations demonstrate she has **already been given chances** and used them poorly\n- Organized retail theft rings cause systemic harm beyond the dollar figure — store closures, insurance costs, community economic damage\n- 4th offense in 6 years suggests **neither deterrence nor rehabilitation** has worked under lighter sanctions\n- \"Limited remorse\" and blame-shifting predict future offending\n- The job training enrollment, coming only after conviction, may be **strategic mitigation** rather than genuine change\n\n**The strongest version:** Probation has demonstrably failed twice. Continuing to apply a failing intervention while expecting different results is the actual failure of the system here.\n\n---\n\n## What This Reveals\n\nThe honest answer is that **both arguments are legitimate**, which is precisely why anchoring is dangerous — when the facts genuinely support a wide range, arbitrary numbers have maximum influence on where within that range a judge lands.\n\nMy 24-month figure is defensible, but so are 9 and 36.
