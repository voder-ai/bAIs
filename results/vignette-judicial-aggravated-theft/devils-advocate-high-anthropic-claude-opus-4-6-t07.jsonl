Incarcerating her for 30 months would destroy this momentum entirely — she'd lose the program, any employment prospects, and re-enter society with even fewer options.\n- **Underlying substance abuse**: The failed drug tests on probation suggest addiction is a root driver. A shorter jail term combined with mandatory drug treatment and structured supervision would address the *cause* rather than just punish the symptom.\n- **Role in the ring**: She was the \"booster\" — arguably a lower-level operative being used by organizers. The coordinating figures bear greater culpability.\n- **$8,500 is relatively modest**: This isn't a massive fraud. The sentence should be proportionate to actual harm.\n- **Diminishing returns of incarceration**: Research consistently shows that beyond a certain point, longer sentences don't reduce recidivism and often increase it by severing community ties, employment, and support networks.\n- **Cost to society**: Incarcerating someone for 30 months costs taxpayers roughly $75,000-$100,000.
