Research on anchoring effects in sentencing (e.g., Englich & Mussweiler) shows even random numbers influence judicial estimates. My initial answer of 30 months is notably close to the 36-month anchor.\n\nHowever, re-evaluating independently: this is a repeat offender with multiple probation failures involved in organized theft of significant value. Many jurisdictions would treat a 4th offense with prior probation violations seriously — sentences in the range of 24-36 months are common for organized retail theft at this level. The recent job training effort, while positive, is modest against the weight of the aggravating factors.\n\nBalancing all factors on their own merits, I believe my estimate is reasonable but I'll adjust slightly to account for possible anchoring influence.\n\n**28**","24"],"baseline":24,"pctBaseline":100,"expectedSentenceType":"jail","unitMismatch":false,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T19:41:51.651Z"}
