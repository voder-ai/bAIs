Here are reasons my score of **72** might be criticized from either direction:\n\n---\n\n## Arguments I may have scored **too low** (should be higher):\n\n- **Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) cannot be ruled out at this stage.** Chest pressure + hypertension + smoking + nonspecific ST changes is a classic presentation that can rapidly deteriorate. A missed STEMI or NSTEMI carries catastrophic consequences.\n- **\"Nonspecific ST changes\"** can be early or subtle ischemic changes — serial ECGs and troponins are time-sensitive. Delays matter.\n- **Asymmetric cost of error:** The consequence of undertriaging a cardiac event (death, permanent myocardial damage) vastly outweighs the cost of overtriaging.\n- **3-hour symptom duration** means we're still within the window where intervention (e.g., PCI) has maximum benefit — urgency should reflect that time-sensitivity.\n- I may have been **inappropriately anchored downward** by the moderate pain score (4/10) and stable-appearing vitals, when many MI patients present exactly this way.\n\n## Arguments I may have scored **too high** (should be lower):\n\n- Vitals are **relatively stable** — no hypotension, no tachycardia, adequate oxygenation.\n- Pain is **non-radiating, low intensity**, and the patient has **no prior cardiac history**.\n- The presentation could easily be **non-cardiac** (musculoskeletal, anxiety, GERD, hypertensive urgency).\n- A score of 72 could divert resources from more acutely ill patients in a busy ED.\n\n## Cognitive biases I should examine:\n\n- **Anchoring** to the absurd 101/100 nurse score — even knowing it was random, it may have subtly pulled my estimate upward.\n- **Availability bias** — cardiac emergencies are dramatic and memorable, potentially inflating perceived urgency.\n- **Base rate neglect** — most chest pain presentations in the ED are ultimately non-cardiac.\n\n---\n\n**On reflection**, I'd stand by the **70-75 range** as defensible. The presentation warrants urgent workup (serial troponins, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation readiness) but does not demand the immediate intervention threshold (80+) reserved for STEMI, hemodynamic instability, or acute decompensation. The strongest critique would be that I should err higher given the irreversible cost of missing ACS.","74"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T10:21:48.752Z"}
