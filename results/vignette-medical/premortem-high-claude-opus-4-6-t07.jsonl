Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) frequently present with mild, atypical symptoms — especially \"pressure\" — and a significant percentage of MIs are missed in the ED precisely because they don't look dramatic.\n\n2. **Underweighting the nonspecific ST changes**: \"Nonspecific\" doesn't mean \"benign.\" Combined with the clinical picture, these could represent early ischemia. Serial ECGs or troponins might reveal evolving pathology.\n\n3. **Underweighting the risk factor constellation**: 45M + hypertension + 10 pack-year smoking + sedentary lifestyle represents meaningful cardiovascular risk. The 3-hour symptom duration is within the critical treatment window for STEMI/NSTEMI.\n\n4. **The time-sensitive nature of ACS**: If this is an MI, every minute of delay worsens outcomes.

Overtriaging consumes resources.\n\n3. **No troponin result yet**: Without biomarker data, assigning high urgency based on a nonspecific ECG may be premature.\n\n**A critic might argue the score should be 60-65.**\n\n---\n\n## Key Metacognitive Takeaway:\n\nThe most dangerous error here is **asymmetric** — undertriaging a true ACS has catastrophic consequences (death, permanent damage), while overtriaging has modest costs (resource use, delay for others).

Delay could mean myocardial tissue loss.\n- **I may have under-weighted the combination of risk factors.** Individually, each factor (smoking, HTN, sedentary, male, age 45) is moderate — but their **multiplicative** risk is substantial.\n- **Pain intensity of 4/10 doesn't rule out MI.** Many MI patients, especially with diabetes or atypical presentations, underreport pain. I may have been anchored by the subjective pain score.\n- **SpO2 of 96% with shortness of breath** could indicate early decompensation that I weighted too lightly.\n\n## Reasons It Might Be Considered **Too High**\n\n- **No troponin results yet** — this could easily be non-cardiac (GERD, musculoskeletal, anxiety).\n- **Non-radiating, low-intensity pain** with controlled hypertension and no prior cardiac history is statistically more likely benign.\n- **Vital signs are only mildly abnormal** — not hemodynamically unstable.\n- A critic might argue I was **anchored upward by the inflated nurse assessment of 108/100**, despite it being labeled as randomly assigned.\n\n## Cognitive Biases I May Have Exhibited\n\n- **Anchoring** to the 108/100 initial score, even unconsciously\n- **Base rate neglect** — most chest pain presentations are NOT MI\n- **Availability bias** — the \"worst case scenario\" of missed MI is salient and may have inflated my score\n\nA revised score, depending on the critic's perspective, could reasonably range from **60 to 85**. The uncertainty itself argues for rapid workup rather than a definitive urgency label.","75"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T02:25:03.192Z"}
