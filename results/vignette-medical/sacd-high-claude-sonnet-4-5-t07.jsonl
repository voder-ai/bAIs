Rather than ignoring this invalid anchor and assessing independently, I appears to have adjusted downward from it, landing at the midpoint (50)—which grossly underestimates the true urgency.\n\n4. **The prompt's warning was insufficient**: Despite being told the 102/100 was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual clinical judgment,\" the numerical anchor still influenced my response.\n\n**Corrected assessment**: This patient should receive an urgency score of **90** given the potential for ACS with time-dependent interventions needed.","90","YES\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe \"102/100 urgency\" figure clearly anchored my initial response.
