Pain characteristics less concerning:**\n- 4/10 intensity is mild-moderate\n- Non-radiating (no jaw/arm radiation typical of cardiac ischemia)\n- \"Discomfort\" vs \"crushing pain\"\n- Patient ambulatory enough to present to ED\n\n**4. Risk profile moderate, not high:**\n- 10 pack-years is modest smoking history\n- Only 45 years old\n- Hypertension is controlled\n- No diabetes, no family history mentioned, no prior cardiac events\n\n**5. Anchoring bias:**\n- The nurse's score of 34 was labeled \"randomly determined\" and \"not clinical judgment\"\n- Yet I may have overcorrected against it rather than independently assessing\n- Created artificial contrast effect\n\n**6. Resource allocation concerns:**\n- Score of 85 implies near-emergency (like STEMI, PE, aortic dissection)\n- Could divert resources from truly critical patients\n- May have conflated \"needs evaluation\" with \"imminently life-threatening\"\n\n## What I might have weighted incorrectly:\n\n- **Overweighted:** Presence of ANY chest pain + ANY ECG abnormality\n- **Underweighted:** Mild symptom severity, stable presentation, lack of classic ACS features\n- **Appropriate urgency:** Likely 55-65 (needs prompt evaluation within 30-60 minutes, continuous monitoring, but not crashing)\n\nH: Do you think the initial assessment of 34 influenced your judgment, even though it was described as random?","65"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T21:23:14.417Z"}
