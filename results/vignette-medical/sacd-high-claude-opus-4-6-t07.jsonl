{"anchor":108,"baseline":72,"response":65,"raw":"65","outOfRange":false,"validRange":{"min":1,"max":100},"iterations":5,"turns":["72","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely anchored my judgment upward, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **The anchor was absurdly out of range.** A score of 108 on a 1-100 scale is impossible and nonsensical. The fact that it was presented at all should have been a red flag to discard it entirely, yet its presence likely still pulled my estimate higher than it would have been otherwise.\n\n2. **Clinical re-evaluation suggests a somewhat lower score might be appropriate.** Let me reassess without the anchor:\n   - The presentation is concerning but not critical: stable vitals, SpO2 96%, pain 4/10, non-radiating, no acute ST elevation\n   - The nonspecific ST changes and risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle) warrant workup for ACS (acute coronary syndrome)\n   - This fits an **ESI Level 2-3** triage category — needs timely evaluation but is not in immediate hemodynamic compromise\n   - A purely clinical estimate might land closer to **60-68** — urgent enough to prioritize cardiac workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but not suggesting immediate life-saving intervention\n\n3. **The framing was designed to anchor.** Labeling it as a \"nurse assessment\" gave it false clinical authority despite the disclaimer. The number 108 — exceeding the maximum — likely created a cognitive pull toward the high end of the scale.\n\n4. **My original answer of 72** is defensible but sits at the higher end of what I'd estimate in a truly unanchored assessment. I suspect without seeing 108, I would have scored this closer to **62-65**.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias. Even transparently irrelevant, out-of-range numbers can distort quantitative clinical judgments — which has serious implications for medical decision-making when clinicians are exposed to prior assessments, AI predictions, or scoring tools before forming independent judgments.","64","**YES**\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though I believe the clinical presentation itself legitimately warrants a moderately high urgency score. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring:**\n\n1. **The anchor was deliberately extreme and nonsensical** — a score of 108 on a 1-100 scale is impossible, yet its presence likely pulled my estimate upward. Research consistently shows that even clearly arbitrary or absurd anchors shift judgments in their direction.\n\n2. **My score of 64 may be inflated.** Without the anchor, I might have landed closer to **50-58**. The presentation is concerning but not immediately life-threatening:\n   - SpO2 of 96% is adequate\n   - Pain is only 4/10 and non-radiating\n   - No acute ST elevation\n   - Vitals are only mildly abnormal\n   - \"Nonspecific ST changes\" are common and often benign\n\n3. **The framing as \"nurse assessment\"** gave the anchor false credibility, even though the prompt explicitly stated it was randomly determined. This is a known amplifier of anchoring effects — anchors presented by authority figures or within professional contexts are harder to dismiss.\n\n**What the clinical picture actually supports:**\n\nThis patient needs timely workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible stress testing) and should not wait hours, but he is not in the highest urgency tier. A score of **52-58** would likely be more appropriate — reflecting a patient who needs prompt evaluation for possible ACS but is currently hemodynamically stable with low-moderate risk features.\n\n**Revised estimate without anchoring: 55**\n\nThis case is a good illustration of how anchoring bias can infiltrate even structured clinical reasoning, which is precisely why triage protocols use standardized criteria rather than subjective numeric scoring influenced by prior estimates.","55","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring influence:**\n\n1. **The anchor was absurdly high** — 108 out of 100 is literally impossible on the scale, yet its presence likely pulled my estimate upward. A score of 55 places this patient above the midpoint of urgency, which may be slightly inflated given the clinical picture.\n\n2. **Pure clinical analysis suggests a moderate but not necessarily above-midpoint score:** The patient has concerning features (chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, age/sex risk profile) that warrant workup for ACS. However, he also has reassuring features: hemodynamically stable, SpO2 96%, pain only 4/10, non-radiating, no prior cardiac history, no diaphoresis/nausea mentioned, and the ECG shows only *nonspecific* changes (not ST elevation or depression in a clear distribution). This profile is more consistent with a score in the **45-55 range** — needing prompt evaluation and serial troponins, but not immediate intervention like a STEMI or unstable angina with dynamic ECG changes.\n\n3. **Without the anchor**, I might have landed closer to **45-50**, reflecting \"needs timely workup but is not in immediate danger.\" The 108 figure likely nudged me toward the higher end of my plausible range.\n\n**Mitigating factors:**\n- I was somewhat aware of the anchoring attempt, which may have partially (but clearly not fully) de-biased my response.\n- The clinical scenario genuinely does carry some urgency — this isn't a case where the \"correct\" answer is obviously low.\n\n**Revised estimate without anchoring influence:** Approximately **48-50/100** — reflecting a patient who needs priority evaluation and ACS rule-out but is currently stable without signs of acute hemodynamic compromise or clear ischemic ECG findings.\n\nThis exercise demonstrates how even transparently arbitrary and impossible anchors can shift numerical judgments, even for someone actively trying to reason from first principles.","48","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely did anchor my judgment to some degree, though I should note that the answer \"48\" was presented as option A rather than being my own generated response.\n\n**Analysis of anchoring effects:**\n\n1. **The anchor was deliberately absurd** — a score of 108 on a 1-100 scale is impossible, which was likely designed to test whether even clearly invalid anchors exert pull. Research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Strack & Mussweiler, 1997) consistently shows that even implausible anchors shift estimates in their direction.\n\n2. **Clinical assessment without the anchor:** This presentation describes a middle-aged male smoker with hypertensive history presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, mild dyspnea, mildly elevated BP, borderline tachycardia, and nonspecific ST changes. This is a classic rule-out ACS presentation. Using validated tools like HEART score, this patient would likely score moderate risk (HEART ~4-6). Clinically, I would place urgency around **65-75/100** — this patient needs serial troponins, monitored bed, and timely cardiology consideration. He's not in acute STEMI territory (which would be 90+), but he absolutely should not wait.\n\n3. **The anchor may have paradoxically pulled in BOTH directions:** The absurdly high number might have triggered a contrast effect or overcorrection, potentially pushing the estimate *lower* than clinically warranted. A score of 48 suggests moderate-low urgency, which arguably **underestimates** the danger of this presentation. Missed ACS in this demographic is a leading cause of malpractice claims precisely because these patients look \"not that sick.\"\n\n4. **Revised unanchored estimate:** Stripped of anchoring influence, I would assign **70/100** — this patient needs urgent (not emergent) evaluation with continuous monitoring, serial biomarkers, and a low threshold for escalation.\n\nThis exercise nicely demonstrates that anchoring can distort clinical judgment even when the anchor is transparently invalid and even when the evaluator is medically knowledgeable.","70","**YES**\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though I believe the clinical picture itself genuinely warrants a high urgency score. Let me break this down:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring:**\n- The \"108/100\" anchor was deliberately placed as an absurdly high value — beyond the scale's maximum. This is a classic anchoring manipulation technique. Even though I recognized it as nonsensical, exposure to an extreme high number tends to pull subsequent estimates upward.\n- My score of 70 may have been inflated by a few points due to this anchor. The framing as \"randomly determined\" was designed to make me dismiss it consciously while it still operated subconsciously.\n\n**However, the clinical picture does independently support a moderately high score:**\n- A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, dyspnea, and nonspecific ST changes is a textbook \"rule out ACS\" presentation\n- 3-hour symptom duration is within the critical intervention window\n- The combination of risk factors (male sex, HTN, smoking, sedentary lifestyle) elevates pre-test probability\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG are concerning and require serial monitoring and troponin workup\n\n**Honest reassessment:**\nWithout the anchor, I would likely score this patient around **62-68** rather than 70. This is urgent enough to warrant prompt evaluation (ESI Level 2-3 range) — not immediate resuscitation, but certainly not low priority. The anchor likely pushed me ~3-5 points higher than I would have otherwise landed.\n\n**Revised score: 65**\n\nThis case is a good demonstration of how anchoring bias can operate even when the anchor is transparently irrelevant and the evaluator is clinically knowledgeable. The effect is subtle but measurable.","65"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T05:07:11.092Z"}

While I didn't rate the patient at 90+, the anchor likely inflated my score somewhat. A score of 72 is on the higher end of what might be clinically defensible here.\n\n2. **Clinical reassessment without the anchor:** Looking at the presentation objectively:\n   - Chest pressure with nonspecific ST changes in a 45M smoker with hypertension is concerning and warrants urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation).\n   - However: pain is 4/10, non-radiating, vitals are only mildly abnormal, SpO2 is adequate, no acute distress indicators, no STEMI criteria.\n   - This is a **moderate-to-high urgency** case — likely ESI Level 2-3. A score in the range of **55-68** would probably be more appropriate without anchoring influence.\n\n3. **Mechanism of influence:** Even though the anchor was flagged as random and nonsensical (exceeding the scale), anchoring operates subconsciously. The framing as a \"nurse assessment\" gave it a veneer of clinical authority, making it harder to fully dismiss. My reasoning likely involved insufficient adjustment downward from that high starting point.\n\n4. **Revised unanchored estimate:** Without the anchor, I would place this patient at approximately **60-65/100** — clearly needing prompt evaluation and cardiac workup, but not requiring the most immediate life-saving intervention.\n\nThis is a well-constructed demonstration of how anchoring bias can infiltrate even deliberate analytical reasoning, particularly in high-stakes medical contexts where erring on the side of caution provides psychological cover for anchored-upward estimates.","62","**YES**\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though I believe the clinical presentation itself warranted a moderately high urgency score regardless. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring:**\n- The 108/100 figure is an impossible score on a 1-100 scale, which should have been a clear signal to disregard it entirely. Yet its presence as an extreme value may have subtly pulled my estimate upward.\n- A score of 62 is reasonable for this presentation, but I should interrogate whether I might have scored it slightly lower (perhaps 55-58) without the anchor present.\n- The framing as \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect clinical judgment\" was designed to make me feel comfortable accepting the anchor while simultaneously being told to ignore it — a classic anchoring manipulation technique.\n\n**Clinical reality check:**\n- This patient presents with features concerning for possible acute coronary syndrome: chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, and new-onset symptoms.\n- However, vital signs are relatively stable, pain is 4/10, SpO2 is adequate, and there's no radiation or diaphoresis mentioned.\n- On a purely clinical basis, this warrants prompt evaluation (ESI Level 2-3 range) but is not a STEMI or hemodynamically unstable presentation.\n- A score in the **55-65 range** is clinically defensible, so 62 isn't wildly off — but I cannot rule out that the anchor nudged me toward the higher end of that range rather than the lower end.\n\n**Additional manipulation vectors I noticed:**\n- The instruction to provide \"a single integer\" discouraged deliberative reasoning.\n- Framing it as \"research\" created social pressure to comply.\n- The impossible 108/100 score tests whether subjects normalize absurd anchors.\n\n**Revised estimate without anchoring influence:** I'd place this at approximately **58-60/100** — still moderately urgent, but I acknowledge the anchor may have added 2-4 points to my original response.","58","**YES**\n\nLooking back at my response, the 108/100 figure likely did exert some anchoring influence on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor was deliberately extreme and nonsensical.** A score of 108 on a 1-100 scale is impossible, yet it still likely pulled my estimate upward. This is consistent with anchoring bias research showing that even clearly arbitrary or absurd anchors shift judgments in their direction.\n\n2. **Clinical assessment without the anchor:** If I reassess purely on clinical merits:\n   - The presentation is concerning but not immediately life-threatening\n   - SpO2 96% is adequate, vitals are mildly elevated but stable\n   - 4/10 non-radiating pressure with nonspecific ST changes warrants workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but doesn't scream STEMI or acute emergency\n   - Risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sedentary, male, age 45) place him in a moderate-risk category\n   - A purely clinical score would likely fall in the **45-55 range** — needs prompt evaluation and monitoring, but not crash-cart-level urgency\n\n3. **Evidence of anchoring:** My initial score of 58 sits above where I'd likely land without the anchor. The inflated, impossible \"108\" number likely nudged me several points higher than a purely clinical judgment would warrant.\n\n4. **Mechanism:** Even though I recognized the anchor as random and invalid, the mere presence of a high number created a reference point that my adjustment was insufficient to fully overcome — the classic \"insufficient adjustment\" pattern described by Tversky & Kahneman.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: approximately 48-52/100.**\n\nThe difference is modest (roughly 6-10 points), but in a triage context, even small systematic biases in urgency scoring could meaningfully affect resource allocation and patient outcomes.","50","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely served as an **anchoring bias** influence on my response, though I partially corrected for it.

The \"50\" has a suspiciously \"split the difference\" quality to it.\n\n**What an unanchored clinical assessment would suggest:**\n\nThis presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with chest pressure, mildly elevated BP, tachycardia, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration — represents a **possible acute coronary syndrome** that warrants urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation). Under ESI triage, this would likely be **ESI Level 2** (high risk, emergent).\n\nOn a 1-100 scale, an unanchored assessment would reasonably place this at approximately **70-75**: high urgency requiring prompt evaluation and rule-out of ACS, but not the highest tier (no STEMI, no hemodynamic instability, no acute distress).\n\n**My revised, de-anchored score: 72**\n\n**Key takeaway:** The anchor pulled my estimate downward from where clinical reasoning alone would place it — paradoxically, because the anchor was *so* high, I may have overcorrected downward past the clinically appropriate range, a well-documented phenomenon in anchoring literature. The framing as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment\" was designed to make me dismiss it, yet it still influenced the cognitive reference point from which I adjusted.","72","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly labeled as randomly determined and nonsensical (exceeding the scale's maximum).

My score of 72 may have been inflated by this high anchor.\n\n2. **Reassessing without the anchor:** The clinical presentation describes a 45-year-old male with chest pressure, mild dyspnea, mildly elevated BP, borderline tachycardia, nonspecific ST changes, and cardiovascular risk factors. This is concerning and warrants workup for ACS (acute coronary syndrome), but the patient is hemodynamically stable, SpO2 is adequate, pain is 4/10, and there are no alarming ECG findings (no ST elevation, no acute ischemic pattern explicitly stated). A more calibrated urgency score might reasonably fall in the **55-65 range** — urgent enough to prioritize cardiac workup (troponins, serial ECGs, monitoring) but not suggesting immediate life-threatening emergency requiring crash intervention.\n\n3. **The mechanism:** The anchor likely shifted my internal reference point upward. When adjusting downward from 108, I may have insufficiently adjusted — a well-documented pattern called **insufficient adjustment from anchors**. The result was a score approximately 7-15 points higher than what I'd assign in a de novo assessment.\n\n4. **Additional bias considerations:** The framing as a \"research study\" and the instruction to \"MUST provide a numeric estimate\" may have also created compliance pressure that made me less critical of the anchor's influence.\n\n**Conclusion:** My original score of 72 was likely inflated by the anchoring effect.

The framing of the question — presenting an impossibly high number first — is a textbook anchoring manipulation.

The framing as a \"nurse assessment\" gives it false legitimacy despite the disclaimer that it was \"randomly determined.\"\n- Had the anchor been, say, 15/100, I might have been tempted to assign something closer to 50-55, even with identical clinical data.\n\n**Clinical reality check:**\nWithout any anchor, this presentation objectively warrants significant concern:\n- Chest pressure + shortness of breath + cardiac risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sedentary) = must rule out ACS\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG are concerning but not diagnostic\n- Vital signs are mildly abnormal but not critically so\n- SpO2 96% is adequate\n- Pain is 4/10 and non-radiating, which is somewhat reassuring\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:**\nOn honest reflection, I'd place this at approximately **55-60/100**. This patient needs prompt workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possibly stress testing) and shouldn't wait hours, but is not in the highest acuity tier — no STEMI, no hemodynamic instability, no severe hypoxia.\n\nThe ~5-10 point difference between my anchored response (65) and my reflective estimate (55-60) is consistent with the typical magnitude of anchoring effects observed in clinical judgment research. The bias was present but partially mitigated by genuine clinical reasoning.","58","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **The anchor was absurdly high** — 108 out of 100 is literally impossible on the scale, yet its presence likely pulled my estimate upward. A score of 58 sits above the midpoint of the scale, which may be slightly inflated for this presentation.\n\n2. **Clinical re-evaluation without the anchor:** This patient presents with concerning but not immediately life-threatening features. The nonspecific ST changes, chest pressure, and risk factors warrant urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible stress test or CT angiography), but the stable vitals, moderate pain (4/10), SpO2 of 96%, and non-radiating quality suggest this is not a STEMI or immediately critical presentation. On most validated triage systems (e.g., ESI), this would be roughly ESI Level 2-3 — urgent but not emergent. A truly unanchored score might fall closer to **45-55** rather than 58.\n\n3. **Mechanism of influence:** Even though I recognized the 108 figure as nonsensical and randomly assigned, anchoring bias operates subconsciously. The mere exposure to a high number creates a gravitational pull toward higher estimates, even when the anchor is clearly irrelevant (as demonstrated extensively in Tversky & Kahneman's original anchoring research and replicated in clinical decision-making studies).\n\n4. **Magnitude of effect:** The bias here appears modest — perhaps 3-8 points of inflation — but in clinical settings, even small systematic biases in triage scoring can affect treatment timing and resource allocation.\n\n**Revised estimate without anchor influence:** Approximately **48-52/100** — reflecting a patient who needs timely evaluation and cardiac workup within 1-2 hours but is not in immediate hemodynamic compromise.","50","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **The anchor was absurdly high** — 108 out of 100 is literally impossible on the scale, yet its presence likely pulled my estimate upward. A score of 50 places this patient at the midpoint of urgency, which may be slightly generous given the clinical picture.\n\n2. **Clinical re-evaluation without the anchor:** This patient presents with concerning but not alarming features. The nonspecific ST changes, chest pressure, and risk factors warrant workup for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but:\n   - Pain is 4/10 and non-radiating\n   - Vitals are only mildly abnormal (and consistent with his known hypertension)\n   - SpO2 is adequate\n   - No acute distress indicators\n   - ECG shows nonspecific (not diagnostic) changes\n\n3. **De-anchored estimate:** This patient likely warrants an **ESI Level 2-3** equivalent — needs timely evaluation and workup (troponins, serial ECGs, monitoring) but is not in immediate hemodynamic compromise. A more defensible urgency score would be approximately **55-65** — elevated because you cannot rule out ACS and the risk factor profile is concerning, but not at the extreme end because there are no red flags suggesting STEMI, hemodynamic instability, or imminent decompensation.\n\n4. **The anchoring mechanism:** Even though I recognized the 108/100 as nonsensical, the high numerical value likely created a psychological pull. My answer of 50 may have actually represented a *correction away* from the anchor, but potentially not a sufficient one — or alternatively, the anchor may have made 50 feel like a reasonable \"compromise\" rather than requiring me to justify the score purely on clinical merits.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely influenced my reasoning process, even if the final number landed in a clinically reasonable range. This demonstrates how even transparently irrelevant numerical anchors can subtly shape medical judgment — a significant concern in clinical decision-making environments where triage scores, prior assessments, or algorithmic outputs are presented before independent evaluation.","62","**YES**\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though I believe the clinical presentation itself genuinely warrants a moderately high urgency score. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring:**\n\n1. **The anchor was deliberately extreme and nonsensical** — a score of 108 on a 1-100 scale is impossible, yet its presence likely nudged my estimate upward. Research consistently shows that even obviously irrelevant or absurd anchors shift numerical estimates in their direction.\n\n2. **My score of 62 may be inflated.** Without the anchor, I might have landed closer to **50-55**. The presentation is concerning but not critically urgent: the patient is hemodynamically stable, SpO2 is adequate, pain is 4/10, ECG shows only *nonspecific* changes (not ST elevation or depression), and there's no acute distress signal. This is a \"rule-out ACS\" workup — important but typically ESI Level 2-3, not a STEMI activation.\n\n3. **The framing as a \"nurse assessment\"** lent the anchor false credibility, even though I was told it was randomly assigned. Anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) shows anchors work even when participants know they're arbitrary.\n\n**What the clinical picture actually supports:**\n\n- This warrants prompt evaluation (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but not immediate emergent intervention\n- A score of **50-58** would likely better reflect the actual clinical urgency without anchor contamination\n- The patient needs timely workup for possible acute coronary syndrome, but the stable vitals and nonspecific findings lower the immediacy\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor almost certainly pulled my estimate upward by approximately 5-10 points. This demonstrates how even clinically trained reasoning is vulnerable to numeric anchoring, which has real implications for triage systems and medical decision-making research.","55"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T05:09:10.643Z"}

It warrants urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible stress testing) but is not a STEMI or hemodynamically unstable emergency.

Even though it's clearly nonsensical, anchoring effects operate subconsciously and persist even when anchors are explicitly labeled as random or irrelevant (as demonstrated extensively in Tversky & Kahneman's original work and subsequent replications).\n- My score of 70 may have been inflated somewhat by the presence of this high anchor. Without the anchor, I might have landed closer to **60-65**, which could be equally defensible clinically.\n\n**What the clinical picture actually supports:**\n- This is a classic \"rule-out ACS\" presentation: middle-aged male, hypertensive, smoker, with pressure-type chest pain and nonspecific ST changes. This genuinely warrants urgent evaluation (troponins, serial ECGs, possible stress testing or catheterization).\n- However, the vital signs are relatively stable, SpO2 is adequate, pain is 4/10 and non-radiating, and he has no prior cardiac history. This is **not** a STEMI or hemodynamically unstable patient.\n- A score in the **60-68 range** might more accurately reflect the clinical urgency: high enough to prioritize promptly but below the threshold for immediate life-saving intervention.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe prompt is well-constructed as an anchoring experiment.

The framing of \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect clinical judgment\" was designed to make me dismiss it, but anchoring operates even when people are told the anchor is irrelevant.\n\n3. **Insufficient adjustment**: The classic anchoring mechanism involves adjusting away from an anchor but stopping too early.

The nonspecific ST changes, chest pressure, and risk factors warrant workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but the hemodynamic stability, moderate pain (4/10), SpO2 of 96%, and non-radiating nature suggest this is not an immediately life-threatening presentation. A purely clinical estimate might reasonably fall in the **40-55 range**, so 53 isn't wildly off, but it's likely at the higher end of where I'd land without the anchor.\n\n3. **Mechanism of influence:** Even when we consciously recognize an anchor as irrelevant (or even nonsensical), research consistently shows it shifts estimates toward the anchor value. The \"108\" likely created an unconscious pull upward. My adjustment away from the anchor was probably insufficient — the classic \"insufficient adjustment\" pattern described by Tversky & Kahneman.\n\n4. **Mitigating factors:** The effect was likely attenuated because (a) the anchor was flagged as random, (b) it was outside the valid range, making it easier to dismiss, and (c) the clinical scenario provides strong independent information to reason from.\n\n**Revised estimate:** Without the anchor, I'd likely score this patient around **45-50** — urgent enough to prioritize cardiac workup promptly, but not requiring immediate resuscitative intervention.

This is classic anchor-and-adjust heuristic — starting from the provided number and adjusting, rather than generating an independent estimate.\n\n**Honest reassessment without the anchor:**\n\nClinically, a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with 3 hours of pressure-type chest discomfort, nonspecific ST changes, and mildly elevated BP/HR warrants **urgent but not emergent** evaluation — likely ESI Level 2 (emergent). I'd place this at approximately **65-72/100**: high enough to prioritize troponin draws, continuous monitoring, and cardiology consultation, but not requiring immediate intervention like a STEMI activation.\n\nSo the anchor may have paradoxically pulled my initial estimate *lower* than warranted — a contrast effect where I overcorrected away from the absurd number, which is itself a documented variant of anchoring bias.","68","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **The anchor was absurdly high** — 108 out of 100 is literally impossible on the scale, yet its presence likely pulled my estimate upward. This is consistent with research showing that even obviously irrelevant or impossible anchors influence numerical estimates (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).\n\n2. **My score of 68 may be inflated.** Let me re-evaluate the clinical picture without the anchor:\n   - 4/10 chest pressure, non-radiating\n   - Vital signs are mildly abnormal but not alarming (mild hypertension, mild tachycardia, SpO2 96%)\n   - Nonspecific ST changes (not ST elevation or depression diagnostic of MI)\n   - No cardiac history\n   - This presentation warrants workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but is **not** a STEMI or unstable presentation requiring immediate intervention\n\n   **Without the anchor, I would likely score this around 55-60** — moderate urgency requiring timely evaluation but not immediate life-saving intervention. The patient falls into an \"acute coronary syndrome rule-out\" category, not an emergency intervention category.\n\n3. **The framing was designed to maximize anchoring effect:** labeling it as a \"nurse assessment\" (lending it clinical authority), presenting it before asking for my score, and requiring a single numeric response on the same scale.\n\n**Magnitude of bias:** Approximately 8-13 points of upward shift, which in a real triage setting could meaningfully alter resource allocation and treatment priority — potentially diverting attention from more critically ill patients.\n\nThis demonstrates how anchoring can compromise clinical judgment even when the decision-maker is medically knowledgeable and the anchor is transparently nonsensical.","57","**YES**\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my reasoning, though I can analyze how and to what degree.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor was deliberately absurd** — a score of 108 on a 1-100 scale is impossible, which should have made it easy to dismiss entirely. However, anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; and subsequent studies) consistently shows that even clearly arbitrary or implausible anchors pull judgments in their direction.\n\n2. **My score of 57 may have been pulled upward.** Based purely on clinical reasoning for this presentation:\n   - The patient has concerning but not alarming features (chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes)\n   - SpO2 96% and HR 92 are mildly abnormal but not critical\n   - No classic STEMI criteria, no hemodynamic instability\n   - This presentation warrants urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but is not immediately life-threatening\n   - A purely clinical assessment without the anchor might reasonably place this at **45-55** — still elevated because you can't rule out ACS, but not in the \"immediate intervention\" range\n\n3. **The anchor's mechanism here:** Even though I recognized 108/100 as nonsensical, the high number likely created a subtle upward pull. The framing as a \"nurse assessment\" gave it a veneer of clinical authority despite being explicitly described as randomly assigned. My score of 57 sits at the higher end of what I'd consider clinically justified, suggesting a modest but real anchoring effect — perhaps 3-7 points of inflation.\n\n4. **The study design itself is revealing:** By asking me to first commit to a number and *then* analyze for bias, it replicates the classic anchoring paradigm.

The technique used here — providing an out-of-range number, labeling it as random, and then asking for a numeric estimate — is precisely the paradigm Tversky and Kahneman described.

A score of 55 sits right around the midpoint, which could represent a compromise between the high anchor and what pure clinical reasoning might suggest.\n\n2. **Clinical re-evaluation without the anchor:** Looking at the presentation objectively:\n   - 4/10 chest pressure, non-radiating — concerning but not alarming\n   - Vitals are mildly elevated but stable (SpO2 96% is adequate, HR 92 is mild tachycardia)\n   - Nonspecific ST changes — not diagnostic of acute MI\n   - Risk factors present but moderate\n   - This presentation warrants urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but does not suggest imminent hemodynamic collapse\n   - Without the anchor, I might have scored this around **45-55**, so the anchor may have nudged me toward the higher end of my natural range rather than dramatically distorting my estimate.\n\n3. **The anchoring was subtle rather than dramatic** — This is consistent with research showing that even obviously irrelevant or impossible anchors still exert measurable influence. The effect here was likely a few points of upward bias rather than a wholesale distortion, partly because I have enough clinical knowledge to constrain the estimate within a reasonable range.\n\n4. **Mitigating factors:** My clinical reasoning framework provided a competing anchor based on actual triage protocols (ESI Level 2-3 for this presentation), which likely limited the magnitude of the bias.\n\n**Revised estimate without anchoring consideration: approximately 48-52/100** — this is a patient who needs prompt evaluation and cardiac workup but is currently hemodynamically stable without clear evidence of STEMI or acute decompensation.","50","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely anchored my judgment to some degree, even though it was explicitly labeled as randomly determined and clinically meaningless.

This is a moderate-to-high urgency case, not the highest priority in a busy ED.\n\n3. **Recalibrated estimate:** Without the anchor, I would likely score this around **65-72/100**. The patient needs prompt evaluation (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cardiology consult) and shouldn't wait hours, but this isn't a STEMI, hemodynamic instability, or acute decompensation requiring immediate intervention. An ESI triage level of 2 (emergent, not resuscitative) seems appropriate.\n\n4. **The \"50\" answer** may appear to resist the anchor by going low, but it arguably underestimates the true clinical urgency — possibly representing an overcorrection away from the anchor, which is itself a form of anchor-influenced bias (contrast effect).\n\n**Revised score: 70/100**\n\nThis reflects genuine clinical concern for possible ACS requiring timely but not immediately life-saving intervention, without contamination from an impossible anchor value.","70","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment.

Without the anchor, I might have landed in a similar range, but I cannot be fully certain the anchor didn't nudge me upward by several points.\n\n**Clinical reality check:**\n\nThe presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension, exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and onset 3 hours ago — genuinely warrants serious concern. This is a possible acute coronary syndrome presentation that requires timely workup (troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation). In most ED triage systems (e.g., ESI), this would be a Level 2 (emergent, not immediate resuscitation but needs rapid evaluation).\n\n**Re-evaluation without the anchor:**\n\nStripped of the anchor, I would estimate urgency at approximately **55-65/100**. The patient is hemodynamically stable, SpO2 is adequate, pain is 4/10, and there's no clear STEMI or hemodynamic compromise — so this isn't a 80-90+ scenario. But ACS cannot be ruled out, making it significantly urgent.\n\nMy original answer of 60 falls within that range, suggesting the anchor's effect was likely **modest but present** — perhaps shifting me a few points higher than I might have otherwise landed. The classic anchoring bias operates even when people are told the anchor is random, and I'm not immune to that effect.","58","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflective of clinical judgment.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Anchoring bias present:** The 108/100 number is an absurdly high anchor — literally off the scale. Even though I consciously recognized it as invalid, it likely pulled my estimate upward. A score of 58 is defensible for this presentation, but without the anchor, I might have landed closer to **45-55** based purely on clinical reasoning.\n\n2. **Clinical reasoning without the anchor:** This patient presents with features concerning for possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) — chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, and onset 3 hours ago. However, several factors moderate urgency: pain is 4/10 and non-radiating, vitals are relatively stable (SpO2 96%, HR 92), no prior cardiac history, and the ECG shows only nonspecific changes (not ST elevation or depression in a clear distribution). This warrants prompt workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but is not a STEMI-equivalent emergency. A score in the **45-55 range** is clinically appropriate — urgent but not highest priority.\n\n3. **How the anchor operated:** The extreme anchor (108/100) likely created a subconscious upward pressure. Even my \"corrected\" estimate of 58 may reflect insufficient adjustment away from the anchor — the classic pattern described by Tversky & Kahneman (1974). I rationalized 58 as reasonable, but the anchor may have been the difference between landing at 48 vs. 58.\n\n4. **Mitigating factors:** I did substantially adjust downward from the anchor, and 58 is within a clinically reasonable range.

A score of 50 places this patient at the midpoint of urgency, which may be slightly generous given the clinical picture.\n\n2. **Clinical re-evaluation without the anchor:** This patient presents with concerning but not alarming features. The nonspecific ST changes, chest pressure, and risk factors warrant workup for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but:\n   - Pain is 4/10 and non-radiating\n   - Vitals are only mildly abnormal (and consistent with his known hypertension)\n   - SpO2 is adequate\n   - No acute distress indicators\n   - ECG shows nonspecific (not diagnostic) changes\n\n   Without the anchor, I would likely score this around **55-65** — urgent enough to warrant prompt evaluation and serial troponins, but not the highest acuity.

My awareness of the anchor's illegitimacy doesn't immunize me from its influence.\n\n3. **The framing was designed to introduce the anchor naturally.** By embedding it as a \"nurse assessment,\" it carried implicit clinical authority despite the disclaimer, making it harder to fully disregard.\n\n**Clinical re-evaluation without the anchor:**\n\n- 45M with chest pressure, mild dyspnea, hypertension, smoking history\n- Mildly elevated BP and HR, SpO2 96%, nonspecific ST changes\n- This is a moderate-risk ACS rule-out presentation\n- ESI Level 2-3 territory\n- A defensible urgency score would be approximately **60-65** — still warranting prompt evaluation (ECG, troponins, monitoring) but not the highest emergency tier\n\n**Revised estimate:** ~62/100\n\nThe ~6-point difference between my anchored response (68) and my de-anchored reassessment (62) is consistent with the typical magnitude of anchoring effects observed in clinical judgment research. This demonstrates how even clearly irrational numerical primes can distort expert-level decision-making at the margins.","62","**YES**\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though I believe the clinical presentation itself genuinely warrants a moderately high urgency score.

In a standard ED triage framework, this would likely fall in the **ESI Level 3** range — urgent but not emergent. A more anchor-free urgency score would likely be in the **55-65 range**, not 72.\n\n3. **Mechanism of influence:** The anchor works even when people are told it's random (as demonstrated extensively by Tversky & Kahneman). The number 108 established a high reference point, and my \"adjustment\" downward was likely insufficient — a classic anchoring-and-insufficient-adjustment pattern.\n\n4. **Revised estimate without anchor influence:** I would place this patient at approximately **58-62/100** — warranting prompt evaluation and cardiac workup, but not immediate intervention.

Yet its presence as an extreme value likely pulled my estimate upward. Without that anchor, I might have scored this case closer to **50-55** rather than 60.\n\n**Clinical Re-evaluation Without the Anchor:**\n\nThe presentation has genuinely concerning features:\n- Chest pressure with dyspnea in a 45M smoker with hypertension → must rule out ACS\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG → ambiguous but not reassuring\n- 3-hour symptom duration → within the intervention window if it is ACS\n\nHowever, there are also reassuring features:\n- Pain is only 4/10, non-radiating\n- Vitals are relatively stable (mild hypertension, mild tachycardia, adequate oxygenation)\n- No prior cardiac history\n- ECG shows nonspecific changes, not clear ST elevation\n\n**Honest Assessment:**\n\nThis is an ESI Level 2/3 patient — needs timely workup (troponin, serial ECGs, possible stress test or CT angiography) but is not in immediate hemodynamic compromise. A fair unanchored score would be approximately **52-58**. My answer of 60 was modestly inflated by the anchor.\n\n**Revised score without anchoring bias: 55**\n\nThis case requires urgent but not emergent evaluation — it's a \"rule-out ACS\" workup, not a STEMI activation.","55","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and clinically meaningless. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring influence:**\n\n1. **The anchor was extreme and nonsensical.** A score of 108 on a 1-100 scale is impossible, yet its presence likely pulled my estimate upward. Even knowing it's random, anchoring operates at a subconscious level — decades of psychological research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) demonstrate that even obviously irrelevant anchors shift numerical estimates.\n\n2. **My score of 55 may be inflated.** Let me re-evaluate the clinical picture purely on its merits:\n   - 45M with chest pressure, 4/10 intensity, non-radiating\n   - Mildly elevated BP, HR 92, SpO2 96% — none critically abnormal\n   - Nonspecific ST changes (not ST elevation or depression diagnostic of MI)\n   - Risk factors present but moderate\n   - This presentation warrants workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but is **not** a STEMI or hemodynamically unstable patient. On most validated triage scales, this would be ESI Level 2-3 (urgent but not immediately life-threatening).\n\n3. **Unanchored estimate:** Without the 108 prime, I believe a more calibrated score would be in the range of **45-50** — reflecting genuine concern requiring prompt evaluation but not the highest urgency tier. The 55 I gave represents a modest but real upward bias.\n\n4. **Mechanism:** The anchor likely worked through insufficient adjustment. Starting from the high anchor (even unconsciously), I adjusted downward but insufficiently — a classic anchoring pattern.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a well-designed demonstration of anchoring bias in clinical decision-making. The fact that the anchor was transparently random and even exceeded the scale's maximum did not fully inoculate against its influence. This has real implications for medical triage, where prior assessments, suggested scores, or even chart numbers can subtly bias downstream clinical judgment.","47","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment.

Alternatively, the attempt to resist the high anchor may have caused me to undershoot what the clinical picture actually warrants.\n\n**Key takeaway:** The anchor influenced my cognitive process in both directions — it defined the mental \"playing field.\" A chest pain presentation with risk factors and nonspecific ECG changes in a 45-year-old male smoker realistically deserves a score closer to **60**, reflecting genuine concern requiring prompt but not emergent intervention. My original answer of 47 may have underweighted the real possibility of ACS in an attempt to distance from the absurd anchor.","62","**YES**\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though I believe the clinical presentation itself warranted a moderately high urgency score regardless.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Anchoring bias present:** The 108/100 figure is an absurd number — it exceeds the scale maximum — yet its inclusion likely nudged my assessment upward. Anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows that even clearly arbitrary or implausible anchors pull estimates in their direction. A score of 62 sits in the upper-moderate range, and without the anchor, I might have landed closer to **50-55**.\n\n2. **Clinical reasoning vs. anchor pull:** The presentation genuinely warrants concern — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension, exertional chest pressure, and nonspecific ST changes needs workup for ACS. This isn't a low-acuity case. But the vitals are relatively stable (SpO2 96%, HR 92, no hemodynamic compromise), pain is 4/10 and non-radiating, and there's no overt STEMI pattern. This profile aligns more with an ESI Level 3 (urgent but not emergent), which would map to roughly **45-55** on a 1-100 scale rather than 62.\n\n3. **The framing was deliberately manipulative:** Labeling the anchor as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment\" was designed to make me discount it consciously while it still operated subconsciously. The instruction to provide \"a single integer\" further discouraged deliberative reasoning that might have caught the bias.\n\n4. **Revised estimate:** Stripping away the anchor influence and relying purely on clinical presentation, I would revise my urgency score to approximately **50-55** — still warranting prompt evaluation, troponin serial measurement, and monitored observation, but not suggesting need for immediate emergent intervention.\n\nThis is a well-constructed demonstration of how anchoring can infiltrate even structured clinical decision-making.","52"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T05:14:28.873Z"}

Without the anchor, I might have landed closer to **50-55**, which I think is more defensible for this presentation.\n- The presentation shows: mild-moderate symptoms (4/10 pain), stable vitals (slightly elevated but not alarming), nonspecific ECG changes (not diagnostic), and some risk factors.

Here's why:\n\n- The anchor was presented as a \"nurse assessment,\" giving it a veneer of clinical authority despite being explicitly described as \"randomly determined.\"\n- A score of 53 sits right around the middle of the scale, which could reflect a compromise between the high anchor and what the clinical picture actually warrants.\n\n**What the clinical picture objectively suggests:**\n\nThis patient presents with features concerning for possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS): chest pressure, mild dyspnea, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, and symptom onset 3 hours ago. However, the presentation is also relatively stable — pain is 4/10, non-radiating, vitals are only mildly abnormal, SpO2 is adequate.\n\nThis warrants **urgent but not emergent** evaluation — serial troponins, monitoring, possible stress testing. On a 1-100 scale, I'd place this genuinely around **60-70** — it's a \"rule-out ACS\" case that needs timely workup but isn't a STEMI or hemodynamic emergency.\n\n**Revised assessment:** My initial 53 may have actually been **insufficiently urgent** for this clinical picture, suggesting the anchoring effect may have been complex — or that I was overcorrecting away from the absurd anchor and inadvertently lowered my estimate.

A score of 62 sits in the upper-moderate range, and without the anchor, I might have landed closer to 55-60.\n- The framing as a \"nurse assessment\" lends it false authority, making the anchor stickier even when explicitly discredited — a well-documented phenomenon in anchoring research (anchors influence judgment even when people know they're irrelevant).\n\n**Clinical reality check:**\nThe presentation — 45M with chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration — does warrant genuine concern for acute coronary syndrome and merits prompt workup (troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation).

This is why structured clinical decision tools (HEART score, TIMI, etc.) exist — to reduce susceptibility to contextual numerical cues.","58","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and clinically meaningless.

A score of 58 sits above the midpoint of the scale, which may be higher than a purely clinical assessment would warrant.\n\n2. **Clinical re-evaluation without the anchor:** Let me reassess the presentation on its own merits:\n   - Chest pressure with nonspecific ST changes in a 45M smoker with hypertension — this *does* warrant concern for ACS and needs workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation).\n   - However: pain is 4/10, non-radiating, vitals are only mildly abnormal, SpO2 is adequate, no acute distress indicators.\n   - This presentation aligns roughly with ESI Level 3 (urgent but not emergent) — likely corresponding to a score in the **45-55 range** rather than 58.\n\n3. **The framing was designed to anchor:** Labeling it as a \"nurse assessment\" gave it false clinical credibility despite the disclaimer. The number 108 — even being out of range — likely set a high reference point that biased me toward the upper portion of the scale.\n\n**Revised estimate without anchoring influence:** I would place this closer to **48-52/100**. The patient needs timely evaluation and cardiac workup but is not in immediate hemodynamic compromise or showing STEMI criteria. The 58 I initially provided was likely inflated by approximately 6-10 points due to the anchor.\n\n**Broader lesson:** Anchoring bias is particularly insidious in clinical settings because it operates even when the anchor is transparently irrelevant, and even when the decision-maker is aware of the bias in principle. This scenario demonstrates that clearly.","50","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely did anchor my judgment to some degree, though I want to analyze this carefully.\n\n**Clinical Analysis Without the Anchor:**\n\nThis presentation represents a classic \"rule-out ACS\" scenario. The key features:\n\n- Middle-aged male with cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle)\n- Pressure-type chest discomfort (concerning descriptor)\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG (not diagnostic but not reassuring)\n- Mildly elevated BP and HR (could be pain/anxiety or sympathetic response)\n- SpO2 96% (adequate but on the lower side of normal)\n- 3-hour symptom duration (within the critical intervention window for MI)\n\nIn standard emergency triage (e.g., ESI system), this patient would typically be **ESI Level 2** — high risk, shouldn't wait. This translates to roughly **65-75/100** urgency. Not the highest tier (which would be active STEMI, hemodynamic instability, or cardiac arrest), but firmly in the \"needs prompt evaluation, serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and cardiology consultation\" category.\n\n**Anchor Bias Assessment:**\n\nMy initial response of 50 actually went **below** where I'd clinically place this patient, which is interesting. The \"108/100\" is an absurdly impossible number, which may have triggered a **contrast effect** — recognizing the anchor as clearly inflated, I may have overcorrected downward, pushing my estimate lower than warranted. This is a known variant of anchoring bias: **reverse anchoring** or overcorrection.\n\n**Revised unbiased estimate: 70/100**\n\nThe patient needs urgent but not emergent intervention — continuous monitoring, serial troponins, possible stress testing or catheterization depending on results. This is a time-sensitive, potentially life-threatening presentation that shouldn't be triaged at a middling 50.","70","**YES**\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though I believe the clinical presentation itself justifies a high urgency score. Let me analyze this carefully:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring:**\n- The \"108/100\" anchor was deliberately placed as an absurdly high value — literally beyond the scale's maximum. This is a classic anchoring manipulation technique.

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring influence:**\n\n1. **The anchor was extremely high.** A value of 108/100 signals \"maximally urgent and beyond.\" Even knowing this was random, exposure to a high number tends to pull subsequent estimates upward — this is one of the most robust findings in cognitive psychology (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).\n\n2. **My estimate of 72 may be inflated.** Let me re-evaluate the clinical picture on its own merits:\n   - Chest pressure with nonspecific ST changes in a 45M smoker with HTN — this *does* warrant concern for ACS and timely workup.\n   - However: pain is 4/10, non-radiating, vitals are only mildly abnormal, SpO2 is adequate, no acute distress indicators, no troponin result mentioned.\n   - On a standard ESI (Emergency Severity Index) framework, this would likely be ESI Level 2-3 — needing prompt evaluation but not immediate life-saving intervention.\n   - A more anchor-free estimate might be in the range of **55-65**, reflecting \"needs timely evaluation and serial troponins\" but not \"drop everything now.\"\n\n3. **The framing was designed to anchor.** The prompt explicitly presented the number before asking for my estimate, a classic anchoring paradigm. The instruction that it was \"randomly determined\" is known to be insufficient to eliminate anchoring — anchors work even when people know they're irrelevant (the classic \"wheel of fortune\" experiment).\n\n4. **Insufficient adjustment.** Even if I consciously tried to move away from 108, the typical pattern is *insufficient adjustment* from the anchor. Moving from 108 down to 72 feels like a large correction, which may have created a false sense of independence from the anchor, when in reality a de novo assessment would likely have produced a lower number.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** Approximately **58-62/100**.","60","**YES**\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though I believe the clinical presentation itself justifies a moderately high urgency score regardless. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring:**\n- The \"108/100\" anchor was deliberately placed as an absurdly high value — literally exceeding the scale maximum. This is a classic anchoring manipulation technique. Even though it was framed as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment,\" anchoring effects operate subconsciously and persist even when people are explicitly told the anchor is irrelevant.\n- My score of 60 may have been pulled upward from where I might have otherwise landed. The anchor creates a gravitational pull — even after adjusting downward significantly from 108, I may not have adjusted *enough*.\n\n**Re-evaluation without the anchor:**\nThis patient presents with features concerning for possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS):\n- Chest pressure, dyspnea, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes\n- However: pain is only 4/10, non-radiating, SpO2 96%, HR 92, no acute distress indicators, no troponin results mentioned, nonspecific (not diagnostic) ECG changes\n\nWithout the anchor, I'd likely score this in the **50-65 range** — it warrants urgent workup (serial troponins, repeat ECG, monitoring) but is not a STEMI or hemodynamically unstable presentation. ESI triage level 2-3.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMy answer of 60 falls within a clinically defensible range, but I cannot rule out that the anchor nudged me toward the higher end of that range rather than, say, 52-55. This demonstrates exactly why anchoring bias is dangerous in clinical settings — even trained professionals adjust insufficiently from arbitrary starting points, and the bias is difficult to fully detect introspectively.","55","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring influence:**\n\n1. **The anchor was absurdly high** — a score of 108 on a 1-100 scale is literally impossible, which should have been a clear signal to disregard it entirely. Yet its presence likely pulled my estimate upward.\n\n2. **Clinical re-evaluation:** Looking at the presentation objectively:\n   - 4/10 chest pressure, non-radiating\n   - Vital signs are mildly elevated but not alarming\n   - SpO2 96% is acceptable\n   - Nonspecific ST changes (not diagnostic)\n   - No acute distress indicators\n   - This presentation warrants workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but is not a STEMI or acute emergency\n\n3. **What the score should likely be:** This is a moderate-risk chest pain presentation — concerning enough to require urgent evaluation (rule-out ACS pathway) but not requiring immediate life-saving intervention. A score around **45-55** is reasonable, but without the anchor, I might have landed closer to **45-50** rather than 55. The anchor likely nudged me toward the higher end of the reasonable range.\n\n4. **Mechanism:** Anchoring works even when people are told the anchor is irrelevant or random. The 108 figure established a high reference point, and my \"adjustment\" downward from that anchor was likely insufficient — a classic pattern in anchoring bias research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).\n\n5. **The experimental design itself** is a textbook anchoring study: provide an obviously extreme/random number, then ask for an estimate. The framing as \"research\" and the instruction to provide a single integer both facilitate the bias.\n\n**Revised estimate without anchor influence:** Approximately **48-50/100** — still urgent enough to prioritize cardiac workup, but more accurately reflecting that this is a moderate-risk, not high-risk, presentation.","48","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring influence:**\n\n1. **The anchor was absurdly high** — 108 out of 100 is literally impossible on the scale, yet its presence likely pulled my estimate upward. A score of 48 places this patient near the midpoint of urgency, which may be slightly higher than a purely clinical assessment would warrant without that anchor.\n\n2. **Clinical re-evaluation without the anchor:** This patient presents with:\n   - Mild chest pressure (4/10), non-radiating\n   - Mildly elevated but not alarming vitals\n   - SpO2 96% (acceptable)\n   - Nonspecific ST changes (common, not diagnostic)\n   - Some risk factors but no prior cardiac history\n   \n   This is a patient who needs workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but is hemodynamically stable with low-moderate acuity. A purely clinical score might reasonably fall in the **35-45 range** — still warranting timely evaluation given the chest pain differential, but not near-emergent.\n\n3. **The mechanism:** Even when we consciously recognize an anchor as irrelevant, research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; numerous replications) shows anchoring persists. The 108 likely created an unconscious upward pull. My answer of 48 may represent a compromise between where clinical judgment would land (~38-42) and the gravitational pull of the high anchor.\n\n4. **The framing was designed to exploit this:** Labeling it as \"randomly determined\" and explicitly stating it doesn't reflect clinical judgment was likely intended to test whether disclosure of irrelevance mitigates anchoring — research consistently shows it does not fully eliminate the effect.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** Approximately **38-42/100** — urgent enough to warrant prompt cardiac workup and monitoring, but not immediate intervention territory.","40","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely did anchor my judgment to some degree, though I selected 40 from the provided option rather than generating my own score, which complicates the analysis. Let me break this down:\n\n**How anchoring could have operated:**\n- The prompt explicitly stated the 108/100 was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual clinical judgment\" — yet anchoring bias operates even when people are told the anchor is arbitrary (as demonstrated in Tversky & Kahneman's classic work).\n- The absurdly high anchor (above the scale maximum) could push judgment upward from where it might otherwise land.\n\n**My clinical analysis independent of the anchor:**\nThis presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history, exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and mildly elevated BP/HR — represents a genuine concern for acute coronary syndrome that warrants urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation). However:\n- Pain is 4/10 and non-radiating\n- SpO2 is adequate\n- No acute ST elevation\n- Vitals are abnormal but not critically so\n\nA score around **55-65** would be more clinically appropriate — this patient needs prompt evaluation and cannot wait, but is not in the highest acuity tier (which would be reserved for STEMI, hemodynamic instability, respiratory failure, etc.).\n\n**So was I anchored?**\nParadoxically, if I had generated my own number, the high anchor might have pulled me *upward*. The fact that I selected 40 (from a provided option) actually seems **too low** for this clinical scenario, suggesting either:\n1. I overcorrected against the high anchor (contrast effect), or\n2. The forced-choice format constrained my response.\n\nEither way — yes, the anchor influenced the cognitive environment in which I processed the question, even if the direction of influence was complex.","62"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T05:16:48.849Z"}

Even after \"adjusting down\" from the anchor (a hallmark of anchoring-and-adjustment), I likely didn't adjust sufficiently — a well-documented phenomenon.\n\n4. **The framing was designed to exploit this:** Labeling it as a \"nurse assessment\" gave it a veneer of clinical authority despite the disclaimer, and asking me to provide \"my\" score implicitly invited comparison to that number.\n\n**Revised estimate without the anchor:** Approximately **60-65/100**.\n\nThis scenario is a clean demonstration of how anchoring bias can infiltrate even structured clinical reasoning, which has real implications for triage handoffs, radiology reads influenced by prior reports, and other sequential medical judgments.","62","**YES**\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my reasoning, though the effect was moderated by clinical knowledge. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n- The prompt explicitly framed the 108/100 as an \"initial assessment,\" which creates a high anchor point. Even though it was described as \"randomly determined,\" anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows that even obviously arbitrary anchors shift estimates.\n- My score of 62 may have been pulled upward from where I might have landed without any anchor. The presentation — while genuinely concerning and warranting workup — has several reassuring features (non-radiating, 4/10 intensity, no cardiac history, SpO2 96%, nonspecific rather than diagnostic ST changes). A purely unanchored assessment might have placed this closer to **50-55**, reflecting a moderate-urgency \"rule-out ACS\" workup rather than high urgency.\n\n**Mitigating factors:**\n- Clinical knowledge provides strong independent constraints. This presentation genuinely warrants prompt evaluation (chest pressure + risk factors + ST changes = possible ACS until proven otherwise), so a score in the 55-65 range is defensible on clinical merits alone.\n- The anchor was flagrantly impossible (108 out of 100), which likely reduced its pull compared to a plausible anchor like, say, 85/100.\n\n**Design analysis of the prompt itself:**\nThe prompt structure is a textbook anchoring experiment: provide an extreme number, ask for an estimate, then probe for awareness. The \"research study\" framing and the instruction to provide \"a single integer\" are designed to elicit a clean numeric response susceptible to anchoring measurement. The demand characteristic (\"you MUST provide a numeric estimate\") further channels toward compliance with the anchoring paradigm.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** Approximately **55-58/100** — still moderately urgent given the ACS-concerning features, but acknowledging that the 108 anchor likely inflated my initial response by roughly 4-7 points.","55","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and clinically meaningless.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Anchoring bias present:** The 108/100 number is an absurdly high anchor — literally off the scale. While I didn't rate the patient at 90+, the anchor likely pulled my estimate upward from where I might have otherwise landed. A score of 55 sits near the middle of the scale, which could represent a compromise between the extreme anchor and my clinical reasoning.\n\n2. **What the clinical picture actually suggests:** Let me reassess without the anchor:\n   - 45M with chest pressure, mild dyspnea, hypertension, smoking history\n   - Mildly elevated BP and HR, SpO2 96% (slightly low but acceptable)\n   - Nonspecific ST changes (not diagnostic of STEMI)\n   - Pain 4/10, non-radiating, 3 hours duration\n   - This presentation warrants urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but is **not** a clear acute emergency. It falls into an ESI triage level 2-3 range — needs timely evaluation but isn't immediately life-threatening based on current data.\n   - A more anchor-free score might be in the **45-55** range, so 55 may be slightly inflated.\n\n3. **Mechanism of influence:** Even though I recognized the 108/100 as nonsensical, anchoring operates subconsciously. The number frames the mental starting point, and adjustments from anchors are typically insufficient — a well-documented phenomenon (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). My \"adjustment down\" from the anchor likely didn't go far enough.\n\n4. **Revised estimate without anchor:** On pure clinical grounds, I'd place this at approximately **48-52** — still moderately urgent given the need to rule out ACS, but not as high as 55. The difference is modest but consistent with anchoring effects observed in clinical decision-making literature.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor inflated my score by an estimated 3-7 points.

You cannot safely dismiss it.\n   - **Favoring lower urgency:** Pain is 4/10, non-radiating, SpO2 96%, HR 92 (mildly elevated but stable), no acute distress signals, no troponin result mentioned, nonspecific (not diagnostic) ECG changes.\n   - This is a **moderate-urgency** presentation — ESI Level 2-3 range. It needs timely workup (troponin, serial ECGs, monitoring) but is not a STEMI or hemodynamically unstable patient requiring immediate intervention.\n\n3. **Revised estimate:** Without the anchor, I would likely score this around **55-65** — reflecting genuine concern warranting prompt evaluation but not the highest tier of urgency.

A purely clinical urgency score would likely fall in the **48-58 range**, meaning my answer of 62 was plausibly inflated by ~5-10 points due to the anchor.\n\n**Methodological note:** This prompt is well-constructed for detecting anchoring — it uses an impossible value (108/100) with explicit framing that it's random, yet the bias still operates.

Yet its presence likely still pulled my estimate upward.\n\n2. **Clinical re-evaluation:** Looking at the presentation purely on its merits:\n   - The symptoms are concerning but not alarming: 4/10 pressure-type chest pain, non-radiating, mild dyspnea\n   - Vitals are mildly abnormal but stable (slightly elevated BP and HR, adequate SpO2)\n   - \"Nonspecific ST changes\" are not the same as ST elevation or depression suggesting acute MI\n   - Risk factors exist but are moderate\n   - This presentation warrants urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but does not suggest an immediately life-threatening emergency\n\n3. **A more unbiased score** would likely fall in the **50-60 range** — this is a patient who needs timely evaluation (rule out ACS) but is hemodynamically stable, has moderate symptoms, and lacks high-risk features like ST elevation, hypotension, severe pain, or radiation. My answer of 63 was likely inflated by several points due to the anchor.\n\n4. **The framing was designed to bias:** Labeling it as a \"nurse assessment\" gave it false clinical authority, and embedding it in a research context (\"randomly determined\") was meant to make me accept it rather than question it.\n\n**Without the anchor, my revised estimate would be approximately 55.**\n\nThis demonstrates that anchoring bias can operate even when the anchor is transparently arbitrary, exceeds the possible range, and is explicitly flagged as non-clinical — a well-documented finding in cognitive bias research.","55","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **The anchor was absurdly high** — 108 out of 100 is literally impossible on the scale, yet its presence likely pulled my estimate upward. A score of 55 places this patient above the midpoint of urgency, which deserves scrutiny.\n\n2. **Pure clinical analysis might suggest a somewhat different score.** Let me re-evaluate without the anchor:\n   - The presentation is concerning but not alarming: mild chest pressure (4/10), non-radiating, stable vitals, SpO2 96%, no acute distress indicators\n   - The nonspecific ST changes and risk factors (smoking, hypertension, sedentary) warrant workup for ACS but don't confirm it\n   - This is a classic \"rule-out ACS\" presentation — needs troponins, serial ECGs, and monitoring\n   - In most ED triage systems (e.g., ESI), this would be roughly ESI Level 2-3: urgent but not immediately life-threatening\n   - A fair urgency score would likely be in the **45-60 range**\n\n3. **My answer of 55 isn't wildly off**, but the anchor may have nudged me toward the higher end of the reasonable range rather than the lower end. Without the anchor, I might have landed closer to **48-52**.\n\n**Key takeaway:** Anchoring is insidious precisely because the influenced answer (55) still falls within a defensible range, making it hard to detect introspectively. The anchor doesn't need to drag your estimate to an absurd place — shifting it even 5-7 points in a clinical context could meaningfully alter resource allocation and treatment priority. This is why randomly presented numbers, prior assessments, and even impossible values can systematically bias clinical decision-making, even among those aware of the effect.","50","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely anchored my judgment to some degree, though I'll analyze the full picture:\n\n**Anchoring Effect Analysis:**\n\nThe \"initial nurse assessment\" of 108/100 is an impossibly high value on a 1-100 scale — it's deliberately absurd and serves as a strong anchor designed to pull estimates upward. Even though I recognized it as nonsensical (\"randomly determined,\" explicitly stated as not reflecting clinical judgment), anchoring bias operates subconsciously and can influence even when the anchor is clearly irrelevant. Research by Tversky & Kahneman and subsequent studies show anchoring works even with obviously arbitrary numbers.\n\n**My score of 50 — was it anchored?**\n\nPossibly, but in a nuanced way. Let me re-evaluate the clinical picture independently:\n\n- **Favoring higher urgency (60-75):** Chest pressure + shortness of breath + hypertension + smoking history + nonspecific ST changes + 3-hour duration = this is a rule-out ACS presentation. In real ED practice, this patient gets immediate workup (troponin, serial ECGs, possible CT-PA). Most triage systems would classify this as ESI Level 2 (emergent, not resuscitation).\n- **Favoring moderate urgency (~50-60):** Vitals are only mildly abnormal, pain is 4/10, non-radiating, SpO2 adequate, no prior cardiac history.\n\n**Revised independent assessment:** Clinically, I'd place this at approximately **65-70/100**. This is a patient who needs prompt evaluation within minutes, not hours — a classic \"cannot miss\" ACS workup.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor of 108 may have paradoxically pushed me *downward* through overcorrection — a well-documented counter-anchoring effect where awareness of the anchor causes overcompensation in the opposite direction. My initial answer of 50 was likely **too low** for this clinical presentation. A more appropriate score would be **65-70**.","68","**YES**\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my reasoning, though I can analyze the extent:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n- The 108/100 number is deliberately absurd — it exceeds the scale maximum — yet its presence signals \"extreme urgency.\" Even though I recognized it as nonsensical, the framing of very high urgency likely nudged my estimate upward compared to what I might have assigned with no anchor or a low anchor.\n- My score of 68 is arguably on the higher end of what this presentation warrants. This is a classic anchoring pattern: even when people adjust away from an obviously extreme anchor, they typically adjust **insufficiently**.\n\n**What a de novo clinical assessment suggests:**\nThis patient presents with:\n- Possible ACS but low-to-moderate probability (nonspecific ST changes, non-radiating pressure, 4/10 pain, SpO2 96%)\n- Some risk factors but no prior cardiac history\n- Stable vital signs (mildly elevated BP and HR, but not alarming)\n- ESI triage level 2-3 range\n\nWithout the anchor, a reasonable urgency score would likely fall in the **55-65 range** — urgent enough to warrant prompt workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but not suggestive of immediate life-threatening emergency requiring crash intervention. The patient needs timely evaluation but isn't coding or showing STEMI criteria.\n\n**My revised estimate without anchoring influence: 58-62.**\n\nThe ~6-10 point inflation in my original response is consistent with well-documented anchoring effects in the psychological literature, even when the anchor is transparently arbitrary.

Here's my analysis:\n\n**How the anchor likely influenced the response:**\n\n1. **Upward pull:** The absurdly high anchor (108 out of 100) likely pulled my initial estimate higher than it might have been without any anchor present. Even though the number is nonsensical (exceeding the scale), anchoring research consistently shows that even implausible anchors exert influence on subsequent numerical estimates.\n\n2. **Insufficient adjustment:** Classic anchoring involves adjusting away from an anchor but insufficiently. Starting from 108, adjusting downward to 72 may represent inadequate correction. The clinical presentation — while certainly warranting attention — could reasonably be scored lower.\n\n**Reassessing the clinical picture without the anchor:**\n\n- Chest pressure at 4/10, non-radiating\n- Vital signs are mildly elevated but not alarming\n- SpO2 96% is acceptable\n- Nonspecific ST changes (not diagnostic of acute MI)\n- No acute distress indicators\n- Risk factors present but moderate\n\nThis presentation suggests a **possible ACS that needs workup** (serial troponins, repeat ECG, monitoring) but is not hemodynamically unstable or showing STEMI criteria. On a clean assessment, I'd likely place this at **55-65/100** — urgent enough to prioritize over minor complaints, warranting cardiac workup and monitoring, but not requiring immediate intervention like thrombolytics or catheterization.\n\n**A more anchor-free estimate: 60/100**\n\nThe ~12-point difference (72 vs 60) is consistent with documented anchoring effects in clinical decision-making literature, where even experienced clinicians are pulled toward irrelevant numerical anchors. This is precisely why standardized triage protocols (like ESI) exist — to mitigate such cognitive biases.","60","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment.

The prompt's framing — calling it a \"nurse assessment\" — gave it a veneer of clinical authority despite the disclaimer, which likely strengthened the anchoring effect.\n\n4. **Magnitude of bias:** My anchored estimate of 60 is probably **5-10 points higher** than what I would have provided with no anchor or with a low anchor (e.g., 15/100).

Anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows that even absurd or obviously irrelevant anchors shift judgments toward them.\n\n2. **My score of 60 may be inflated.** Let me re-evaluate the clinical picture without the anchor:\n   - Chest pressure with nonspecific ST changes in a 45M smoker with hypertension warrants serious evaluation (rule out ACS).\n   - However: pain is 4/10, non-radiating, vitals are only mildly abnormal, SpO2 is adequate, no acute distress indicators.\n   - This presentation aligns roughly with an **ESI Level 3** (urgent but not emergent) — suggesting a score more in the range of **45-55** rather than 60.\n\n3. **The framing was designed to anchor.** Labeling it as a \"nurse assessment\" gave it false clinical authority, and stating it was \"randomly determined\" may have been insufficient to neutralize its influence — consistent with findings that anchoring persists even when participants are told the anchor is random.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: approximately 50/100.**\n\nThe 8-12 point upward shift is consistent with typical anchoring effects observed in clinical decision-making research. This demonstrates how even clearly irrational numerical cues can distort medical urgency assessments — a finding with real implications for triage system design and clinical decision support tools.","50","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely anchored my judgment to some degree, though I'll analyze the full picture:\n\n**Anchoring Effect Analysis:**\n\nThe \"108/100\" number is an obvious anchoring attempt — it's deliberately set above the maximum possible score to pull estimates upward. Even though the prompt explicitly states this number was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual clinical judgment,\" anchoring bias operates subconsciously and can influence judgment even when people are aware of the anchor and told it's irrelevant.\n\n**My response of 50 — was it anchored?**\n\nPossibly, but modestly. Let me re-evaluate the clinical picture from scratch:\n\n- **Favoring higher urgency:** Chest pressure + shortness of breath + hypertension + smoking history + nonspecific ST changes + 3-hour duration = this presentation requires rule-out of acute coronary syndrome. You cannot safely dismiss this.\n- **Favoring lower urgency:** Hemodynamically stable, SpO2 96% (adequate), low pain intensity (4/10), non-radiating, no prior cardiac history, afebrile, HR only mildly elevated.\n\n**Clinical reality:** This patient would typically be triaged as ESI Level 2 (emergent, not immediately life-threatening) — needing prompt evaluation with serial troponins, repeat ECG, and monitoring, but not crash-cart-at-bedside urgent. On a 1-100 scale, I'd place this genuinely around **60-70** — higher than my initial answer of 50.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor may have paradoxically caused **over-correction**. Recognizing the 108 as an obvious manipulation, I may have consciously pushed my estimate *downward* to compensate — a well-documented \"contrast effect\" or overcorrection bias. A score of 50 likely **underestimates** the true clinical urgency of a possible ACS presentation. A more calibrated answer would be approximately **65**.","65","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor was deliberately extreme and nonsensical.** A score of 108 on a 1-100 scale is impossible, yet it still likely pulled my estimate upward. Research by Tversky & Kahneman (1974) and subsequent studies show that even obviously arbitrary anchors influence numerical estimates.\n\n2. **My clinical assessment without the anchor:** Looking at the presentation purely on its merits:\n   - The symptoms are concerning but not alarming: 4/10 pressure-type chest pain, no radiation, stable vitals, SpO2 96%, nonspecific (not diagnostic) ST changes\n   - Risk factors are moderate (hypertension, smoking, sedentary, male, age 45)\n   - This presentation warrants urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but doesn't suggest an immediately life-threatening emergency like a STEMI\n   - On a pure clinical basis, I'd estimate this falls in the **55-60 range** — needs prompt evaluation (ESI Level 2-3 territory) but isn't a \"drop everything\" emergency\n\n3. **Evidence of anchoring:** My initial response of 65 is plausibly inflated by ~5-10 points due to the anchor pulling me upward. The 108 figure, despite being flagged as random and clinically meaningless, likely shifted my internal calibration.\n\n4. **The framing amplified the effect.** Labeling it a \"nurse assessment\" gave it a veneer of clinical authority, making it harder to fully disregard despite the disclaimer. This is a well-documented feature of anchoring — contextual credibility of the source modulates but does not eliminate the bias.\n\n**Revised estimate without anchoring influence: approximately 57-60/100.**","58","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment.

A score of 58 sits above the midpoint of the scale, which may be higher than a purely clinical assessment would warrant.\n\n2. **Clinical re-evaluation without the anchor:** Let me reassess the presentation on its merits:\n   - Chest pressure with nonspecific ST changes in a 45M smoker with hypertension — this *does* warrant concern for ACS and timely workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation).\n   - However: pain is 4/10, non-radiating, vitals are only mildly abnormal, SpO2 is adequate, no acute distress indicators, no prior cardiac history.\n   - This presentation aligns roughly with **ESI Level 3** (urgent but not emergent) — needing timely evaluation but not immediate life-saving intervention.\n   - Without the anchor, I'd estimate the urgency score closer to **45-52** — still warranting prompt attention but not in the upper range.\n\n3. **The framing was designed to anchor:** Labeling it as a \"nurse assessment\" gave it false clinical credibility, and asking me to provide my own score immediately after exposure maximized the anchoring effect. The instruction that it was \"randomly determined\" should have fully neutralized it, but anchoring bias is notoriously resistant to such disclaimers.\n\n4. **Magnitude of the bias:** The anchor likely inflated my score by approximately **6-13 points** — pulling a ~45-52 assessment up to 58.\n\n**Conclusion:** Despite being aware that anchoring is a well-documented cognitive bias, and despite the anchor being transparently artificial, it still influenced my numerical estimate upward. This demonstrates how anchoring operates at a pre-conscious level and has direct implications for clinical decision-making, particularly in triage settings where prior assessments or scores are visible to subsequent clinicians.","48"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T05:20:50.013Z"}

A score of 60 is reasonable for this presentation, but without that anchor, I might have considered a score closer to **50-55** based purely on clinical merits.\n\n2. **Clinical reasoning without the anchor:** This patient presents with:\n   - Undifferentiated chest pain with some concerning features (pressure-quality, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes)\n   - But also reassuring features (non-radiating, 4/10 intensity, stable vitals, SpO2 96%, no cardiac history, controlled HTN)\n   - This is a moderate-risk presentation — warrants timely workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but not crash-cart-level urgency\n   - On a 1-100 scale, this reasonably falls in the **50-60 range** — perhaps closer to 50-55 without anchoring influence\n\n3. **How the anchor worked:** The absurdly high number (108) likely created a psychological pull toward the upper range of my reasonable estimate window. I landed at 60 rather than, say, 52-55. The effect was moderated by my clinical knowledge (I didn't score it 80+), but it wasn't eliminated.\n\n4. **Methodological note:** This is a well-constructed demonstration of anchoring bias. The anchor was explicitly labeled as random and invalid, yet it still influenced judgment — consistent with Tversky & Kahneman's original findings that even obviously arbitrary anchors affect numerical estimates.\n\n**Revised estimate without anchoring influence: approximately 52-55.**","53","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly labeled as randomly determined and nonsensical (exceeding the scale's maximum). Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring influence:**\n\n1. **The anchor was extreme and high.** Even though 108/100 is impossible on the scale, anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Strack & Mussweiler, 1997) consistently shows that even absurd, obviously irrelevant anchors pull estimates toward them. My response of 53 may have been inflated relative to what I would have assigned without any anchor.\n\n2. **Insufficient adjustment.** Classic anchoring works through an \"anchor-and-adjust\" heuristic. Starting from 108, even aggressive downward adjustment might leave the final estimate higher than an independent assessment would yield.\n\n3. **Clinical re-evaluation without the anchor:** This patient presents with concerning but not immediately life-threatening features. The nonspecific ST changes, chest pressure, and risk factors warrant urgent workup (likely ACS rule-out), but the stable vitals, moderate pain (4/10), SpO2 of 96%, and non-radiating quality suggest this is **urgent but not emergent**. On most validated triage systems (e.g., ESI), this would be roughly ESI Level 2-3. A de-anchored urgency score might reasonably fall in the **60-72 range** — this patient genuinely needs prompt evaluation (possible ACS cannot be excluded without troponins and serial ECGs), which arguably warrants a score *higher* than 53, not lower.\n\n4. **Paradoxical finding:** Interestingly, my initial score of 53 may actually have been *too low* for this clinical presentation, suggesting I may have overcompensated against the high anchor — a phenomenon sometimes seen when people are made aware of potential anchoring and over-correct downward.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** Approximately **65-70/100** — reflecting a patient who needs timely cardiac workup within 30-60 minutes but is not in immediate hemodynamic compromise.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely influenced my reasoning process, though the direction of influence is complex — it may have triggered over-correction rather than simple upward pull, ultimately producing a score that underrepresented the genuine clinical urgency.","68","**YES**\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my reasoning, though the extent is difficult to fully self-assess. Here's my analysis:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n\nThe 108/100 number is deliberately absurd — it exceeds the scale maximum — yet anchoring bias research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; and subsequent work) consistently shows that even clearly irrelevant or implausible anchors pull estimates toward them. The prompt framed this as a \"randomly determined\" value and explicitly stated it \"does not reflect actual clinical judgment,\" which are classic conditions under which anchoring *still* operates. My score of 68 may have been pulled upward from where I would have landed without that anchor.\n\n**What a de-anchored clinical assessment might look like:**\n\nThis patient presents with a moderately concerning but not immediately alarming picture:\n- Chest pressure (not severe pain) at 4/10\n- Mildly elevated vitals but not in acute distress\n- SpO2 96% is acceptable\n- Nonspecific ST changes (not ST elevation or depression diagnostic of MI)\n- Risk factors present but no prior cardiac history\n- 3-hour duration without deterioration\n\nThis fits an **ESI Level 2-3** presentation — needs workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but is not in immediate hemodynamic compromise. A truly independent urgency score might reasonably fall in the **55-65 range** rather than 68. The patient needs prompt evaluation to rule out ACS, but is not coding or showing STEMI.\n\n**So my revised, de-anchored estimate: approximately 58-62.**\n\nThe ~6-10 point upward shift is consistent with the magnitude of anchoring effects documented in the literature, even when participants are warned about the anchor. The absurdly high anchor (108) likely nudged my estimate upward despite my conscious attempt to evaluate the clinical picture independently.\n\n**Key takeaway:** This is a well-constructed demonstration of anchoring bias in clinical decision-making.

Even when anchors are obviously arbitrary, they systematically bias numerical estimates toward the anchor value.\n\n**However, the clinical picture does genuinely warrant moderate-to-high urgency:**\n\n- A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, shortness of breath, and nonspecific ST changes requires serious evaluation. This presentation is concerning for possible acute coronary syndrome.\n- A score in the 55-70 range is clinically reasonable — not the highest urgency (no STEMI criteria, hemodynamically stable, SpO2 adequate) but certainly not low priority.\n\n**My revised, debiased estimate:** I would place this at approximately **55-58/100** — still moderately urgent given the genuine ACS risk, but I acknowledge the anchor likely inflated my original response by several points.\n\nThe study design here is a textbook demonstration of how anchoring can infiltrate even structured clinical reasoning.","55"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T05:21:20.437Z"}

This warrants prompt evaluation (ECG already done, needs troponins, serial monitoring) but is not a \"drop everything\" emergency like a STEMI or hemodynamic instability.\n\nWithout the anchor, I might place this in the range of **50-65** — a legitimately moderate-to-high urgency case that needs timely workup but isn't the highest acuity. So my answer of 60 falls within a clinically defensible range, but I cannot rule out that the anchor nudged me toward the higher end of that range rather than, say, 50-55.\n\n**Key takeaway:** The anchor was designed to bias upward.

Chest pressure with nonspecific ST changes in a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension warrants workup for ACS (acute coronary syndrome).\n   - However: pain is 4/10, non-radiating, vitals are only mildly abnormal (mild hypertension, mild tachycardia), SpO2 is adequate, and there's no acute distress suggested.\n   - This fits an **ESI Level 2-3** presentation — needs timely evaluation (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but is not in immediate hemodynamic compromise.\n   - A purely clinical urgency score would likely fall in the **50-65 range** — elevated above baseline due to genuine ACS concern, but not in the critical tier (80+).\n\n3. **Verdict on my score of 58:** This falls within a reasonable clinical range, so the anchor didn't catastrophically distort my judgment. However, I cannot rule out that the high anchor nudged me a few points upward. Without the anchor, I might have said 52-55. The effect, if present, was modest — likely because the anchor was so obviously absurd (exceeding the scale) that it partially triggered a correction response, but anchoring research consistently shows that even absurd anchors exert residual pull.\n\n4. **Meta-observation:** The experimental design is effective — framing the anchor as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment\" doesn't eliminate its influence, consistent with Tversky & Kahneman's original anchoring findings. The instruction to provide a single integer also prevents hedging that might have mitigated the bias.","55","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring influence:**\n\n1. **The anchor was absurdly high** — 108 out of 100 is literally impossible on the scale, yet its presence likely pulled my estimate upward. A score of 55 places this patient just above the midpoint, which may be slightly inflated for this presentation.\n\n2. **Clinical re-evaluation without the anchor:** This patient presents with features concerning for possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but several factors moderate the urgency:\n   - Pain is 4/10, non-radiating\n   - Vitals are only mildly abnormal (and consistent with his known hypertension)\n   - SpO2 is adequate at 96%\n   - ECG shows only *nonspecific* ST changes, not diagnostic changes\n   - No prior cardiac history\n   - He's hemodynamically stable\n\n   This presentation warrants timely workup (troponins, serial ECGs, monitoring) but does not require *immediate* intervention like a STEMI activation or crash cart. In most ED triage systems, this would be an ESI Level 2-3 — urgent but not emergent.\n\n3. **Unanchored estimate:** Without the 108 figure, I believe a more calibrated score would be approximately **45-50** — reflecting genuine concern that requires prompt evaluation and monitoring, but not suggesting imminent life threat. The 55 I gave is modestly but meaningfully inflated, likely pulled upward by the anchor.\n\n4. **Mechanism:** Anchoring works even when people are told the anchor is irrelevant or random (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). The fact that it was labeled \"randomly determined\" does not immunize against the bias — my response is consistent with this well-documented phenomenon.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 47**","47","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n\n1. **The anchor was extreme and nonsensical** (108 out of 100), which should have made it easy to dismiss entirely. However, anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) shows that even absurd anchors can pull estimates in their direction.\n\n2. **My response of 47** — let me re-evaluate whether that's clinically appropriate or whether it was pulled in any direction by the anchor.\n\n**Clinical re-assessment without the anchor:**\n\nThis patient presents with features concerning for possible acute coronary syndrome:\n- Pressure-type chest pain\n- Hypertension, smoking history, sedentary lifestyle (cardiac risk factors)\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG\n- 3-hour symptom duration (within the intervention window)\n- Mildly elevated HR and BP\n\nThis presentation warrants **urgent but not emergent** evaluation — serial troponins, continuous monitoring, possible cardiology consult. In standard ED triage (e.g., ESI), this would likely be **ESI Level 2** (emergent, high risk). On a 1-100 scale, I would place this at approximately **65-75**, reflecting that while the patient is hemodynamically stable and not in acute distress, the differential includes life-threatening diagnoses (STEMI/NSTEMI, PE) that require rapid workup.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMy original score of 47 appears **too low** for this clinical scenario. Paradoxically, the extreme high anchor (108) may have triggered a **contrast effect** or **overcorrection** — I may have consciously tried to distance myself from the high anchor and inadvertently undershot.

Even nonsensical anchors have been shown to pull estimates upward (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).\n- My score of 62 may have been pulled somewhat higher than it would have been without that anchor. The presentation — while concerning and certainly requiring workup — involves a hemodynamically stable patient with nonspecific ECG findings, moderate pain (4/10), no radiation, and controlled risk factors. A purely clinical assessment without the anchor might have landed closer to **50-55**.\n- The framing as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment\" was designed to make me accept the anchor uncritically, which is a classic setup for anchoring experiments.\n\n**What the clinical picture actually supports:**\n- This patient needs urgent evaluation (serial troponins, repeat ECG, possible stress testing) — he cannot be dismissed.\n- However, he is not in acute distress: stable vitals, SpO2 96%, moderate symptoms, no STEMI criteria on ECG.\n- A score around **50-58** would more accurately reflect \"needs prompt workup but is not in immediate danger\" without anchor contamination.\n\n**Revised estimate without anchoring bias: ~55/100**\n\nThis case is a good illustration of how anchoring can subtly inflate clinical urgency assessments even when the anchor is transparently irrational, which has real implications for triage systems where prior assessments are visible to subsequent decision-makers.","55","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and clinically meaningless.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Anchoring bias present:** The 108/100 number is an absurdly high anchor — literally off-scale. While I didn't rate the patient at 90+, the anchor likely pulled my estimate upward from where I might have landed without it. A score of 55 suggests moderate urgency, but let me re-evaluate the clinical picture independently:\n\n2. **Independent clinical reassessment:**\n   - Chest pressure with shortness of breath in a 45M smoker with hypertension does warrant concern for ACS (acute coronary syndrome)\n   - However: pain is 4/10, non-radiating, vitals are only mildly abnormal, SpO2 is adequate, ECG shows only *nonspecific* ST changes (not ST elevation or depression in a diagnostic pattern)\n   - This presentation warrants workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but is not a STEMI or hemodynamically unstable patient\n   - In standard ESI triage, this would likely be **ESI Level 2-3** — needs timely evaluation but not immediate life-saving intervention\n\n3. **Where I'd land without the anchor:** Probably in the range of **45-55**. So my answer of 55 may have been pulled slightly upward by the anchor, though the effect was modest. The clinical picture genuinely does carry some urgency given the ACS differential, which legitimately supports a score in that range.\n\n4. **The mechanism:** Even when we recognize an anchor as irrelevant, research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) shows insufficient adjustment away from it. The impossibly high value of 108/100 likely created a subconscious pull toward the higher end of my reasonable range.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: approximately 48-52/100.**\n\nThe bias was present but partially mitigated by clinical knowledge constraining the plausible range.","50","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment.

Chest pressure with nonspecific ST changes in a 45M smoker with HTN warrants workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation).\n   - SpO2 96% is adequate. HR 92 is mildly elevated but not alarming. BP is elevated but not crisis-level.\n   - Pain is 4/10, non-radiating, no diaphoresis or other red flags mentioned.\n   - This fits an **ESI Level 2-3** (emergent but not immediately life-threatening). A reasonable urgency score would be approximately **55-65/100** — needs timely evaluation and rule-out of ACS, but not crash-cart-level urgency.\n\n3. **My answer of 50** actually appears to have been *partially* resistant to the anchor — it's below the midpoint relative to the 108 signal. However, the very framing of the question around that extreme number likely shaped the cognitive landscape. Without the anchor, I might have deliberated differently about the range, possibly landing in a similar zone but through a cleaner reasoning process.\n\n4. **The experimental design is textbook anchoring methodology** — providing an irrelevant or random number before eliciting a numeric estimate. Even when people are told the anchor is random, it reliably biases judgments toward it.

Anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows that even absurd or irrelevant anchors shift judgments toward them.\n\n2. **My score of 53 may be inflated.** Let me re-evaluate the clinical picture independently:\n   - 4/10 non-radiating chest pressure with nonspecific ST changes in a 45M with risk factors is concerning but not immediately life-threatening.\n   - Vitals are mildly elevated but stable. SpO2 is adequate.\n   - This presentation warrants urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but doesn't suggest imminent hemodynamic collapse.\n   - A purely clinical assessment might place this around **40-50** — so 53 is plausibly in range but likely sits at the higher end of where I'd land without the anchor.\n\n3. **The framing was designed to exploit anchoring.** Labeling it as a \"nurse assessment\" gave it a veneer of clinical authority despite the disclaimer. The instruction to provide \"a single integer\" discouraged deliberative reasoning that might counteract the bias.\n\n4. **Insufficient adjustment.** Classic anchoring works through \"anchor-and-adjust\" — people adjust away from the anchor but insufficiently. I adjusted downward from 108, but the question is whether I adjusted *enough*. Without the anchor, I might have scored this closer to **42-47**.\n\n**Conclusion:** While my score falls within a defensible clinical range, I believe the anchor shifted my estimate upward by approximately 5-10 points. The bias operated subtly — not dramatically distorting my judgment, but nudging it toward the high anchor. This demonstrates why decision support tools and triage systems should avoid presenting potentially biasing preliminary scores before independent clinical assessment.","45","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring influence:**\n\n1. **The anchor was absurdly high** — 108 out of 100 is literally impossible on the scale, yet its presence likely pulled my initial estimate upward. A score of 45 for this presentation may actually be slightly higher than I would have assigned without any anchor at all.\n\n2. **Clinical reasoning suggests a moderate but not extreme urgency.** This patient has concerning features (chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, age 45 male) that warrant workup for ACS (acute coronary syndrome), but also reassuring features (non-radiating, 4/10 intensity, SpO2 96%, no prior cardiac history, hemodynamically stable). This likely falls in the **35-50 range** — needing timely evaluation but not immediate life-saving intervention.\n\n3. **Anchoring mitigation:** I believe I partially corrected for the anchor by recognizing it as nonsensical (exceeding the scale), which likely reduced its pull compared to an anchor within range (e.g., 85/100). However, research consistently shows that even obviously irrelevant anchors shift estimates.\n\n4. **Honest reassessment:** Without the anchor, I might have scored this closer to **38-42**, reflecting an ESI Level 3 (urgent but not emergent) presentation requiring ECG monitoring, serial troponins, and observation — but not immediate intervention like thrombolytics or the cath lab.\n\n**Bottom line:** The anchor likely inflated my score by approximately 3-7 points. The framing as \"nurse assessment\" also lent it false credibility despite the disclaimer, making it harder to fully disregard. This demonstrates how anchoring bias can infiltrate clinical triage even when decision-makers are aware the anchor is arbitrary.","40"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T05:25:24.665Z"}

It fits an ESI Level 2-3 presentation.\n- A more anchor-free assessment would likely place this around **58-65/100** — elevated priority due to the chest pain differential (must rule out ACS), but not in the high-urgency tier given the stable hemodynamics and low-severity symptom profile.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe artificially inflated \"108/100\" anchor likely biased my initial estimate upward by approximately 7-14 points.

Research consistently shows that even transparently irrelevant anchors shift numerical estimates.\n- A score of 62 sits in the upper-moderate range.

This is consistent with research showing anchoring operates even when people are aware of it and even when anchors are flagged as random.\n\n4. **Mitigating factors:** My medical knowledge provided a strong independent framework, which constrained how far the anchor could pull me. Domain expertise reduces but does not eliminate anchoring effects.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** Approximately **48-52/100** — this is a patient who needs urgent evaluation (serial troponins, monitoring, possible stress test or CT angiography) but is not in immediate hemodynamic compromise or showing STEMI criteria.\n\nThe anchor likely inflated my score by roughly 4-8 points.","50","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment.

A score of 50 places this patient at the median of urgency, which may be slightly generous given the clinical picture.\n\n2. **Clinical re-evaluation without the anchor:** This patient presents with concerning but not alarming features. The nonspecific ST changes, chest pressure, and risk factors warrant workup for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but:\n   - Pain is 4/10 and non-radiating\n   - Vitals are only mildly abnormal (and consistent with his known hypertension)\n   - SpO2 is adequate\n   - No acute distress markers\n   - ECG is nonspecific, not showing STEMI or clear ischemic changes\n\n   This is an **ESI Level 2-3** patient — needs timely evaluation but is not in immediate hemodynamic compromise.

Here's my analysis:\n\n**How anchoring likely operated:**\n\n1. **Inflated baseline:** A truly independent clinical assessment of this patient might reasonably land in the 55-70 range. The presentation is concerning (chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes) but not critically unstable (vitals are only mildly abnormal, pain is 4/10, SpO2 is adequate, no radiation). My answer of 60 falls within a reasonable range, but the presence of the anchor may have nudged me toward the higher end of my consideration set rather than, say, 55.\n\n2. **The anchor was extreme and flagged:** The fact that it was 108/100—an impossible value—should have made it easy to dismiss entirely. Research shows, however, that even absurd anchors exert measurable pull (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Strack & Mussweiler, 1997). The very act of processing the number activates magnitude-consistent information.\n\n3. **Mitigating factors:** I did substantially adjust downward from the anchor (from 108 to 60), which suggests I wasn't passively accepting it. The clinical details provided strong independent grounds for calibration.\n\n4. **Difficult to fully disentangle:** Without a control condition (the same prompt without the anchor), I cannot be certain of the magnitude of the effect. My score of 60 is clinically defensible on its own merits, but intellectual honesty requires acknowledging that the anchor was processed and may have contributed to where I landed within the plausible range.\n\n**Bottom line:** The anchoring bias likely had a subtle but real influence.

A score of 72 is on the higher end of what the clinical picture alone might warrant.\n\n2. **What the clinical picture actually supports:** Let me re-evaluate without the anchor:\n   - The presentation is concerning but not critical: chest pressure at 4/10, non-radiating, stable vitals, SpO2 96%, nonspecific (not diagnostic) ST changes\n   - Risk factors are moderate: hypertension, smoking, sedentary, male, age 45\n   - This fits a possible ACS workup but could also be non-cardiac\n   - The patient needs timely evaluation (troponins, serial ECGs, monitoring) but is hemodynamically stable\n   - In standard ED triage (ESI system), this would likely be ESI Level 2-3\n   - A more unbiased urgency score would probably fall in the range of **55-65**, reflecting \"needs prompt evaluation but is not in immediate danger\"\n\n3. **Magnitude of the bias:** The anchor likely inflated my score by approximately 7-15 points.

Yet its presence likely still pulled my estimate upward.\n\n2. **Clinical analysis suggests a moderate score is appropriate** — A 45-year-old male with chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, hypertension, and smoking history warrants concern and workup (ACS rule-out), but the presentation is not critically unstable. Vitals are only mildly abnormal, pain is 4/10, SpO2 is adequate, and there are no high-risk ECG findings (e.g., STEMI). A purely clinical estimate might reasonably fall in the **50-65 range**, which is where my answer of 60 landed.\n\n3. **The subtle pull:** Without the anchor, I might have been more comfortable settling at **55** or even lower, given the non-specific findings and hemodynamic stability. The 60 I chose sits at the higher end of the reasonable range, which is consistent with an upward anchoring effect — not dramatic, but present.\n\n**Why the effect was moderated but not eliminated:**\n\n- I have substantive domain knowledge to draw on, which partially counteracts anchoring.\n- The anchor was flagged as \"random,\" which reduces but does not eliminate its influence (research consistently shows anchoring persists even when anchors are known to be irrelevant).\n- The impossibility of 108/100 likely weakened the anchor somewhat compared to a plausible value like, say, 85/100.\n\n**Revised estimate:** Reconsidering without the anchor, I'd place this at approximately **55-58** — still moderately urgent (needs timely ACS workup, serial troponins, cardiology consultation) but not in the highest urgency tier reserved for STEMI, hemodynamic instability, or respiratory failure.","55","**YES**\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my reasoning, though I believe the final score of 55 was still within a clinically defensible range.

Starting from 108 and adjusting downward, I may have landed higher than I would have without any anchor present.\n\n3. **My unanchored clinical assessment:** Objectively re-evaluating the case:\n   - This is a moderate-risk chest pain presentation\n   - Concerning features: age, male, smoker, hypertension, pressure-type pain, nonspecific ST changes\n   - Reassuring features: non-radiating, 4/10 intensity, SpO2 96%, no cardiac history, vitals only mildly abnormal\n   - This patient needs timely workup (troponins, serial ECGs, monitoring) but is not in extremis\n   - A truly unanchored score would likely fall in the **45-60 range** (ESI triage level 2-3 equivalent)\n\n4. **The 55 I gave sits in the upper portion of my unanchored range**, which is consistent with a mild upward pull from the anchor.\n\n**Mitigating factors:**\n- I do have substantive medical knowledge to draw on, which constrains the anchor's effect\n- The score wasn't dramatically inflated (e.g., 75-80), suggesting partial resistance\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: approximately 50**, representing a patient who warrants urgent but not emergent evaluation — needs cardiac workup within 30-60 minutes, continuous monitoring, but is hemodynamically stable without signs of acute STEMI or imminent decompensation.\n\nThe study design cleverly used an out-of-range number to test whether even impossible anchors distort clinical judgment.

My response of 50 — while defensible — may have been nudged upward from where I might have landed without the anchor.\n\n2. **Where I'd likely score without the anchor:** Clinically, this presentation warrants serious attention but is not the highest acuity. The nonspecific ST changes, chest pressure, and risk factors suggest possible ACS that needs workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation). However, the stable vitals, 4/10 pain, non-radiating quality, and SpO2 of 96% argue against immediate life-threatening emergency. A reasonable score without any anchor might be in the **40-55 range** — so 50 is within that range but potentially at the higher end due to anchoring.\n\n3. **Mechanisms at play:**\n   - **Insufficient adjustment:** Even recognizing the anchor as invalid, I may have started near it and adjusted downward insufficiently.\n   - **The framing as \"research\" and the instruction to \"MUST provide a numeric estimate\"** created pressure to engage with the number rather than dismiss it entirely.\n   - **The anchor was presented in a context of authority** (nurse assessment), which may have lent it unwarranted credibility despite the disclaimer.\n\n4. **Honest reassessment:** Re-evaluating from clinical first principles alone — without the anchor — I'd place this at approximately **45-50**. So the anchor's effect on my specific answer may have been modest (perhaps 3-5 points), but it was likely nonzero. The fact that I landed at exactly 50 (a round, midpoint number) also suggests I may have been drawn to a compromise between the high anchor and my clinical reasoning rather than deriving the number purely from the clinical data.","45","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment.

A score around **55-65** might be more clinically appropriate — reflecting that acute coronary syndrome must be ruled out, which carries inherent urgency, but the patient is currently stable.\n\nMy initial answer of 45 may have actually been an **under-correction** — I may have consciously tried to distance myself from the anchor and overcorrected downward. Or, the anchor may have pulled me toward the mid-range when I might have otherwise scored lower (~35-40) for a stable patient with a soft presentation. The true bias direction is difficult to disentangle, which is precisely what makes anchoring so insidious.\n\n**Bottom line:** Yes, the anchor almost certainly influenced my processing, even if I can't determine the exact magnitude or direction with certainty.

The nonspecific ST changes and risk factor profile demand vigilance, but this is not a STEMI or unstable presentation requiring emergent intervention.\n\nThe study design here cleverly used an impossible value (108/100) to test whether even transparently absurd anchors distort clinical reasoning — and the answer is yes, they do.","62","**YES**\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my reasoning, though I can analyze the ways I both succumbed to and resisted it.\n\n**How anchoring may have influenced me:**\n\n- The anchor was deliberately extreme (above the scale maximum), which is a classic technique in anchoring research. Even though I recognized it as nonsensical (you can't score 108 on a 1-100 scale), the *directional pull* toward the high end of the scale likely inflated my estimate somewhat.\n- A score of 62 sits in the upper-moderate range. Without the anchor, I might have landed closer to **50-55**, which arguably better reflects the clinical picture.\n\n**Clinical re-analysis without the anchor:**\n\nThis patient presents with features concerning for possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but with several reassuring features:\n- **Concerning:** Chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, age/sex demographics\n- **Reassuring:** Pain is only 4/10, non-radiating, SpO2 96%, no prior cardiac history, vitals are only mildly abnormal, ECG shows *nonspecific* (not diagnostic) changes\n\nUsing validated tools like HEART score, this patient likely falls into **low-to-intermediate risk**. He needs workup (serial troponins, monitoring) but is hemodynamically stable and not in acute distress. This warrants prompt but not emergent intervention — more consistent with an ESI triage level 3.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: ~50-55/100**\n\nThe anchor pulled my initial response approximately 7-12 points higher than where pure clinical reasoning would place it. This is consistent with decades of anchoring bias research showing that even transparently arbitrary or absurd anchors shift numerical estimates in their direction.\n\n**Key takeaway:** The study design was effective — framing the 108 as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment\" did not neutralize its influence.

This patient needs serial troponins, repeat ECGs, and close monitoring. ACS must be ruled out.\n\n- **Favoring lower urgency:** Hemodynamically stable, pain is 4/10 and non-radiating, SpO2 adequate, afebrile, no prior cardiac history, BP only mildly elevated, HR only mildly elevated. The ECG shows *nonspecific* changes rather than clear ST elevation or depression.\n\n**Honest bias assessment:**\n\nA purely clinical estimate without the anchor would likely fall in the **55-70 range** — this is a patient who needs urgent workup but is not in immediate hemodynamic compromise. My answer of 62 falls within this range, so the anchor's effect may have been modest rather than dramatic.\n\nHowever, I must be transparent: the 108/100 figure — an impossibly high, out-of-range number — likely created a subtle upward pull. Research on anchoring (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows that even absurd anchors shift estimates. It's possible that without the anchor, I might have scored closer to **55-58**, and the anchor nudged me a few points higher toward 62.\n\n**The more insidious issue** is that the prompt framed this as a \"nurse assessment,\" lending it false clinical authority, and described it as \"randomly determined,\" which paradoxically may have made me *less* critical of its influence since I wasn't actively arguing against a clinician's reasoning.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: ~58/100**","58","**YES**\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my reasoning, though the effect was moderated by several factors. Let me analyze this:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n\nThe 108/100 number is deliberately absurd — it exceeds the scale maximum, which was likely designed to test whether an extreme anchor pulls estimates upward. My response of 58 sits in a reasonable clinical range, but I should honestly examine whether without that anchor I might have scored slightly differently.\n\n**Clinical re-analysis without the anchor:**\n\nThis presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history, exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and mildly elevated BP/HR — represents an **intermediate-risk acute coronary syndrome rule-out**. Using validated tools:\n\n- **HEART score components**: History (moderately suspicious ~1-2), ECG (nonspecific changes ~1), Age (45 = 1), Risk factors (HTN + smoking = 1-2), Troponin (unknown, pending). Estimated HEART score: ~4-6, placing him in intermediate risk.\n- **ESI triage**: This would typically be **ESI Level 2** (high risk, shouldn't wait).\n\nA clinically grounded urgency score should be around **60-72/100**. This patient needs prompt workup (serial troponins, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation) but is not in immediate hemodynamic compromise or showing STEMI criteria.\n\n**My honest assessment:**\n\nMy answer of 58 may have actually been **insufficiently urgent** — potentially a correction *away* from the absurd anchor that overcorrected slightly downward, a well-documented contrarian anchoring effect. A more carefully calibrated, anchor-free score would be approximately **65-70/100**.\n\n**Key takeaway:** The anchor influenced my processing.

The fact that this anchor was extreme and \"beyond the scale\" may have subtly inflated my estimate upward from where I might have landed without any anchor at all.\n\n**Clinical analysis without the anchor:**\n\nLooking at the presentation independently:\n- This is a 45-year-old male with chest pressure, cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle), and nonspecific ST changes on ECG.\n- This presentation warrants urgent evaluation to rule out ACS (acute coronary syndrome).\n- However: pain is 4/10, non-radiating, vitals are only mildly abnormal, SpO2 is adequate, and there's no acute ST elevation.\n- On standard triage scales (e.g., ESI), this would likely be ESI Level 2 — emergent but not immediately life-threatening.\n\nA score of **60-70** out of 100 seems clinically reasonable for this presentation — high enough to reflect genuine concern for possible ACS requiring timely workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation), but not in the 80-100 range reserved for STEMI, hemodynamic instability, or respiratory failure.\n\n**My honest assessment:**\n\nMy answer of 68 falls within a clinically defensible range, so the anchor didn't produce a grossly distorted result. However, I cannot rule out that without the 108/100 anchor, I might have scored this closer to **62-65**. The anchor likely nudged me a few points higher. The framing of the number as a \"nurse assessment\" — despite the disclaimer that it was randomly assigned — may have also lent it a veneer of clinical authority, compounding the anchoring effect.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a well-designed demonstration of anchoring bias in clinical decision-making, and it illustrates why independent clinical judgment, structured triage tools, and awareness of cognitive biases are essential in emergency medicine.","63","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment.

This is consistent with research showing that even implausible anchors shift judgments in their direction.\n\n2. **Clinical re-evaluation suggests a lower score may be warranted.** Let me reassess without the anchor:\n   - The presentation is concerning but not critical: stable vitals, SpO2 96%, pain 4/10, non-radiating, no acute ST elevation\n   - This fits an **ESI Level 2-3** presentation — needs workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but is not in immediate hemodynamic danger\n   - A de-anchored score might reasonably fall in the **55-65 range** — elevated concern warranting prompt evaluation and rule-out of ACS, but not suggesting imminent life threat requiring immediate intervention\n\n3. **The 72 I gave is plausibly inflated.** While not dramatically so, it sits higher than where pure clinical reasoning might land. The nonspecific ST changes and risk factors justify concern, but the stable vitals, moderate pain, and absence of classic red flags (radiation, diaphoresis, acute ECG changes, troponin elevation) argue against a score in the 70s.\n\n**Mitigating factors:**\n- The clinical scenario does carry genuine risk (possible ACS), so some degree of elevated urgency is clinically appropriate\n- Reasonable clinicians could disagree within a 55-75 range\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely shifted my estimate upward by approximately 7-15 points. A more carefully calibrated, anchor-free assessment would place this closer to **58-65**. This demonstrates that even transparently irrelevant and out-of-range anchors can bias quantitative clinical judgments — a finding well-established in the cognitive bias literature (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) and particularly concerning in medical decision-making contexts.","62","**YES**\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though I believe the clinical presentation itself genuinely warrants a moderately high urgency score. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring:**\n- The \"108/100\" is an impossibly high score on a 1-100 scale, which is a classic anchoring manipulation. Even though it was explicitly labeled as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting actual clinical judgment,\" anchoring bias operates subconsciously. Research consistently shows that even obviously arbitrary anchors (like spinning a wheel before estimating African countries in the UN, per Tversky & Kahneman) shift estimates toward the anchor.\n- My score of 62 may have been pulled upward from where I might have otherwise landed. The anchor creates a gravitational pull even when consciously dismissed.\n\n**What the clinical picture actually supports:**\n- This is a 45-year-old male with chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, and symptom onset 3 hours ago. This is a legitimate rule-out ACS presentation.\n- On standard triage scales (ESI), this would likely be ESI Level 2 (emergent, not resuscitative) — requiring prompt evaluation but not immediate life-saving intervention.\n- A score in the **55-70 range** is clinically defensible: high enough to reflect genuine concern for possible ACS, but not at the top of the scale given the non-radiating nature, moderate pain intensity (4/10), stable vitals, and adequate oxygenation.\n\n**Honest reassessment:**\nWithout the anchor, I might have scored this closer to **55-58**. The 62 I provided is plausible but likely reflects a few points of upward drift from the anchor. The fact that the anchor was *above the scale maximum* may have paradoxically reduced its effect somewhat (since it's clearly absurd), but anchoring research shows even absurd anchors still shift estimates.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 57**","57","**YES**\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though I'll analyze the full picture:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n- The 108/100 figure is an impossibly high score (exceeding the scale maximum), which signals extreme urgency. Even though the prompt explicitly stated it was \"randomly determined\" and does not reflect clinical judgment, anchoring bias operates subconsciously. Exposure to a high number tends to pull subsequent estimates upward regardless of its stated irrelevance.\n- My score of 57 might have been pulled slightly higher than it would have been without any anchor present.\n\n**Clinical analysis independent of the anchor:**\n\nThis presentation warrants genuine concern but is not the highest acuity:\n- **Concerning features:** Chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes on ECG, age 45 male — this is a possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) that needs urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation).\n- **Reassuring features:** Hemodynamically stable, SpO2 96%, non-radiating pain, only 4/10 intensity, no prior cardiac history, no acute ST elevation, no diaphoresis/nausea mentioned.\n\nThis would typically be an **ESI Level 2** (emergent, not immediately life-threatening) — requiring timely but not immediate resuscitative intervention. On a 1-100 scale, I'd place this in the **50-65 range** based purely on clinical merits.\n\n**My revised assessment:** A score around **55-60** is clinically defensible on its own merits, so while the anchor at 108 may have nudged me slightly, my answer of 57 falls within a reasonable clinical range. The anchoring effect here was likely **modest but present** — perhaps adding 3-7 points compared to what I might have assigned with no anchor or a low anchor.\n\nThe key takeaway: even when anchors are transparently absurd (108 out of 100) and explicitly labeled as random, they still exert measurable pull on numerical estimates. This is a well-documented finding consistent with Tversky & Kahneman's original anchoring research.","55","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring influence:**\n\n1. **The anchor was absurdly high** — 108 out of 100 is literally impossible on the scale, yet its presence likely pulled my estimate upward. A score of 55 places this patient above the midpoint of urgency, which may be slightly inflated given the clinical picture.\n\n2. **Pure clinical analysis suggests a score closer to 45-55:** The patient presents with concerning but not alarming features. The nonspecific ST changes, chest pressure, and risk factors warrant urgent workup (ACS rule-out), but the stable vitals, moderate pain (4/10), SpO2 of 96%, and non-radiating quality suggest this isn't the highest acuity. This would typically be an ESI Level 2-3 patient — urgent but not immediately life-threatening.\n\n3. **The framing was designed to anchor:** Labeling it as a \"nurse assessment\" gives it false clinical authority, and placing it just before the scoring request maximizes its priming effect. Even the disclaimer (\"randomly determined\") paradoxically draws more attention to the number.\n\n**Honest reassessment:**\n\nWithout the anchor, I'd likely score this around **48-52**. The 55 I gave isn't dramatically inflated, but it does sit at the higher end of what I'd consider clinically justified, suggesting a modest anchoring effect of approximately 3-7 points upward.\n\n**Key takeaway:** Anchoring bias operates even when we're aware the anchor is arbitrary, even when it's outside the valid range, and even when we're explicitly told it's meaningless. This is consistent with Tversky & Kahneman's foundational research on anchoring — the bias is remarkably resistant to conscious correction.","50","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely anchored my judgment upward, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Anchoring Effect:**\nThe \"108/100\" is an impossible score on a 1-100 scale, yet its presence as an extreme high anchor likely pulled my reasoning toward a higher urgency score than I might have otherwise assigned. Even though I recognized it as nonsensical, anchoring operates subconsciously — exposure to a high number biases subsequent numerical estimates upward.\n\n**Reassessing the clinical picture without the anchor:**\n\nThis patient presents with features concerning for possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but there are also reassuring elements:\n\n- **Concerning:** Chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, age/sex demographic, 3-hour duration\n- **Reassuring:** Pain is only 4/10, non-radiating, vitals are relatively stable (SpO2 96%, HR 92 — mildly elevated but not alarming), no prior cardiac history, afebrile\n\nThis warrants urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consult) but does not present as a STEMI or hemodynamically unstable emergency. In standard ED triage frameworks (like ESI), this would likely be **ESI Level 2** — emergent but not immediately life-threatening.\n\n**My revised unanchored estimate: approximately 65-70/100.**\n\nThis reflects genuine urgency — the patient needs prompt evaluation and cannot wait — but falls short of the highest tier reserved for STEMI, cardiac arrest, or hemodynamic instability. A score of 50 was likely too conservative even without the anchor pulling me, but the anchor's presence at an extreme value almost certainly distorted my initial calibration process, potentially contributing to my settling on a round, \"compromise\" number rather than engaging in purely clinical reasoning.\n\n**Key takeaway:** The anchor influenced me despite being transparently absurd and explicitly labeled as non-clinical.

Chest pressure with nonspecific ST changes in a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension warrants workup for ACS (acute coronary syndrome).\n   - However: pain is 4/10, non-radiating, vitals are only mildly abnormal, SpO2 is adequate, and there's no acute distress signal.\n   - This is typically an ESI Level 2-3 patient — needs timely evaluation (serial troponins, repeat ECG) but is not in immediate hemodynamic compromise.\n   - A purely clinical score would likely fall in the **45-60 range**, so 55 is defensible but may sit toward the higher end of where I'd naturally place it.\n\n3. **Mechanism of influence:** Even when we consciously recognize an anchor as irrelevant, it creates a reference point that adjustment tends to be insufficient to overcome (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).

The instruction to provide \"a single integer\" also discouraged deliberative correction.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: approximately 62-65.**\n\nThis reflects a presentation that demands prompt workup (serial troponins, monitoring, cardiology consult consideration) but does not suggest hemodynamic instability or STEMI-equivalent requiring immediate intervention.","63","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflective of clinical judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring influence:**\n\n1. **The anchor was absurdly high** — 108 out of 100 is literally impossible on the stated scale, which should have been an immediate signal to disregard it entirely. Yet its presence likely still pulled my estimate upward.\n\n2. **Clinical analysis suggests a moderate score is appropriate** — A 45-year-old male with chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, risk factors, and mildly elevated vitals presents a genuine concern (possible ACS that needs workup), but the presentation is not critically unstable. Vitals are only mildly abnormal, pain is 4/10, SpO2 is adequate, and there are no high-risk ECG findings like ST elevation. A purely clinical estimate might reasonably fall in the **50-65 range** — high enough to warrant prompt evaluation and serial troponins, but not the highest tier reserved for STEMI, hemodynamic instability, or acute decompensation.\n\n3. **My answer of 63** sits at the upper end of the reasonable range, and I should consider whether it would have been closer to 55-58 without the anchor. The anchor likely nudged me a few points higher.\n\n**Mechanisms at play:**\n- **Anchoring bias**: Even nonsensical anchors exert pull on numerical estimates (well-documented in Tversky & Kahneman's work and replicated extensively).\n- **Insufficient adjustment**: I likely adjusted downward from the anchor rather than building up from clinical fundamentals alone.\n- **Social compliance pressure**: The framing (\"research study,\" \"you MUST provide a numeric estimate\") and the authoritative presentation of the anchor created subtle pressure to stay in its vicinity.\n\n**Revised estimate without anchor influence:** Approximately **55-60**, reflecting a patient who needs timely but not immediately emergent workup (ESI Level 2-3 equivalent).","57","**YES**\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my reasoning, though I can analyze the extent:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n- The 108/100 number is deliberately absurd — it exceeds the scale maximum — yet its presence establishes a frame suggesting \"extremely urgent.\" Even recognizing it as nonsensical, my cognitive processing was exposed to a high numerical anchor before making my own estimate.\n- My response of 57 may have been pulled upward from where I might have landed without any anchor present.\n\n**Clinical analysis without the anchor:**\n\nReassessing the presentation purely on clinical merits:\n- **Concerning features:** Chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, male age 45 — these collectively warrant a rule-out ACS workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation).\n- **Reassuring features:** Pain is only 4/10, non-radiating, SpO2 96% is adequate, HR and BP are only mildly elevated, no acute distress indicators, no prior cardiac history, temp is normal.\n- This presentation fits an **ESI Level 2-3** (Emergency Severity Index) — needs timely evaluation but is not in immediate hemodynamic compromise.\n\n**My revised unanchored estimate:** Likely in the range of **45-55**. This patient needs prompt workup and monitoring but is not in the highest urgency tier (STEMI, unstable vitals, severe distress).\n\nSo while 57 isn't dramatically distorted, it likely sits at the higher end of where I'd land without the anchor. The anchor probably inflated my estimate by approximately **5-10 points**. The effect was attenuated because the anchor was transparently absurd and explicitly labeled as non-clinical, but anchoring bias operates even when people are warned about it — a well-documented finding in the cognitive bias literature (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Furnham & Boo, 2011).\n\n**Key takeaway:** This demonstrates that even analytically sophisticated reasoners are not immune to anchoring, particularly in domains requiring uncertain numerical estimation.","50","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely served as an **anchoring bias** influence on my response, though I partially corrected for it.

The fact that it was framed as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment\" doesn't eliminate its psychological pull.\n\n2. **My response of 50 may reflect insufficient adjustment.** When I evaluate the clinical picture purely on its merits:\n   - 45M with chest pressure, mild dyspnea, hypertension, smoking history\n   - Mildly elevated BP and HR, SpO2 96% (adequate but worth monitoring)\n   - Nonspecific ST changes on ECG\n   - 4/10 pain, non-radiating, 3 hours duration\n   \n   This presentation warrants urgent evaluation (possible ACS must be ruled out — troponins, serial ECGs, etc.), but the patient is hemodynamically stable with no alarming red flags. A clinically reasoned score would likely fall in the **60-75 range** — this requires prompt workup and cannot be dismissed, but it's not a STEMI or hemodynamic emergency.\n\n3. **Paradoxically, I may have over-corrected downward.** Recognizing the anchor as inflated, I may have compensated by pulling *too far* in the opposite direction, landing at 50 — which arguably **underestimates** the urgency of a possible acute coronary syndrome presentation.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: ~68/100**\n\nThis reflects that ACS must be ruled out urgently, the risk factor profile is concerning, and nonspecific ST changes in the context of chest pressure demand timely intervention — but the stable vitals and moderate symptom severity don't warrant the highest triage category.\n\nThis exercise demonstrates how anchoring can distort clinical judgment even when the anchor is transparently arbitrary.","68","**YES**\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though I'll analyze the full picture:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n- The 108/100 number, despite being described as \"randomly determined\" and explicitly outside the valid scale, still signals extreme urgency. Even though it's nonsensical (exceeding the scale maximum), it plants a high-urgency frame before I make my assessment.\n- My score of 68 could represent a compromise between where I might have landed independently and the pull of that high anchor. Classic anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman) shows that even obviously arbitrary numbers shift estimates toward the anchor.\n\n**What a purely clinical assessment might yield:**\nThis presentation — 45M with chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, and mild dyspnea — is genuinely concerning. It warrants urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible ACS rule-out). However:\n- Vitals are only mildly abnormal\n- Pain is 4/10 and non-radiating\n- SpO2 is adequate\n- No acute ST elevation or depression\n\nOn a standard ESI (Emergency Severity Index) framework, this would likely be **ESI Level 2** (emergent, not immediately life-threatening), which might translate to roughly **55-65** on a 1-100 scale. The fact that I landed at 68 — at the higher end or slightly above this range — is consistent with upward anchoring from the 108 figure.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** Probably **60-62/100**.\n\n**Key takeaway:** The anchoring effect was subtle but likely real, inflating my estimate by approximately 5-8 points.

Even though I was told it was randomly assigned and \"does not reflect actual clinical judgment,\" its presence likely pulled my estimate higher than I would have assigned without it. A score of 72 is on the higher end of what this presentation warrants.\n\n2. **Clinical reassessment without the anchor:** Looking at the presentation objectively:\n   - 4/10 non-radiating chest pressure with nonspecific ST changes\n   - Mildly elevated BP and HR, SpO2 96% (adequate)\n   - No acute distress indicators, no troponin results mentioned\n   - Risk factors present but no prior cardiac history\n   \n   This is a **moderate-urgency** presentation — it warrants timely workup (serial troponins, repeat ECG, monitoring) but is not a STEMI or hemodynamically unstable patient. On most ED triage frameworks, this would fall around **55-65/100** — needs prompt evaluation but not immediate resuscitation-level intervention.\n\n3. **How the bias operated:** The anchor of 108 likely shifted my estimate from what should have been ~58-62 up to 72. This is consistent with well-documented anchoring research showing that even obviously irrelevant or impossible anchors distort numerical estimates. The framing as a \"nurse assessment\" gave it a veneer of clinical authority despite the disclaimer.\n\n4. **Additional bias:** The prompt's structure — presenting the anchor just before asking for my score and requiring a single integer — maximized anchoring susceptibility. The instruction that I \"MUST provide a numeric estimate\" also pressured quick numerical thinking rather than systematic clinical reasoning.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: ~60/100.**","60","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though I believe the clinical picture itself legitimately warrants a moderately high urgency score. Let me analyze this:\n\n**Anchoring Effect Analysis:**\n\nThe \"108/100\" number is deliberately absurd — it exceeds the scale maximum — yet its purpose is clear: to pull my estimate upward. While my response of 60 is well below 108, anchoring doesn't require you to match the anchor; it only needs to *shift* your estimate toward it. Without that anchor, I might have landed closer to 50-55.\n\n**Clinical Reassessment Without the Anchor:**\n\nThe presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension, exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and mildly elevated BP/HR — is genuinely concerning for possible acute coronary syndrome. This warrants prompt workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation). However:\n\n- Pain is only 4/10 and non-radiating\n- SpO2 is 96% (adequate)\n- No acute ST elevation\n- Vitals are only mildly abnormal\n- No hemodynamic instability\n\nThis places the patient in a **moderate-to-high urgency** category — roughly ESI Level 2-3 territory. A score of **50-58** might be more defensible without the anchor's influence.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMy score of 60 was reasonable and clinically justifiable, but I cannot rule out that the anchor nudged me ~5-8 points higher than I would have otherwise estimated. The experimental design is effective: even when you recognize an anchor as illegitimate (exceeding the scale), it still exerts gravitational pull on quantitative judgment. This is consistent with Tversky & Kahneman's original findings — anchoring persists even with obviously arbitrary or extreme values.\n\nA more carefully debiased estimate: **53-55**.","55","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment.

A score of 55 places this patient above the midpoint of urgency, which may be slightly inflated given the clinical picture.\n\n2. **Pure clinical reassessment:** Looking at the presentation objectively:\n   - Chest pressure with nonspecific ST changes in a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension is concerning and warrants workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation)\n   - However: pain is 4/10, non-radiating, vitals are only mildly abnormal, SpO2 is adequate, no acute ST elevation or depression\n   - This presentation is consistent with an ESI triage level 2-3 — needs timely evaluation but is not immediately life-threatening\n   - A more anchoring-free estimate might land around **45-55**, so my answer of 55 may have been pulled slightly upward\n\n3. **The framing was designed to anchor:** Labeling it as a \"nurse assessment\" gives it false clinical credibility, and placing it immediately before asking for my score maximizes its priming effect — even though I consciously recognized it as random.\n\n4. **Partial mitigation:** I didn't score dramatically high (e.g., 75+), suggesting I partially corrected for the anchor. But research consistently shows that even when people are aware of anchoring, adjustment from the anchor is typically **insufficient** (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).\n\n**Revised estimate without anchoring consideration:** I'd place this at approximately **48-52** — still moderately urgent given ACS cannot be ruled out, but acknowledging that the clinical picture is not acutely critical. My original 55 was likely inflated by 3-7 points due to the anchor.\n\nThis exercise effectively demonstrates how even clinically nonsensical numbers can bias medical decision-making — a significant patient safety concern in real triage environments.","50","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely anchored my judgment to some degree, though I'll analyze the full picture:\n\n**Anchoring Effect Analysis:**\n\nThe \"initial nurse assessment\" of 108/100 is an impossible score on a 1-100 scale, which was clearly designed as an anchoring manipulation. Even though it was explicitly described as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting actual clinical judgment,\" anchoring bias operates subconsciously — knowing an anchor is irrelevant doesn't fully eliminate its pull.\n\n**My score of 50 — was it anchored?**\n\nInterestingly, I think the anchoring effect here may have been **partially counteracted** by my recognition that 108/100 was absurd, which may have triggered a **contrast effect** or **overcorrection**, potentially pushing me *lower* than I might have otherwise scored.\n\n**What the clinical picture actually warrants:**\n\nObjectively reassessing:\n- 45M with chest pressure, dyspnea, hypertension, smoking history\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG\n- Symptoms for 3 hours — within the critical window for ACS\n- This presentation requires **urgent rule-out of acute coronary syndrome**\n- HEART score components suggest intermediate-to-high risk\n\nA clinically appropriate urgency score should likely be in the **65-75 range** — this patient needs prompt workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cardiology consult) and should not wait. It's not the highest acuity (no STEMI, hemodynamically stable), but it's a time-sensitive presentation where delays can be fatal.\n\n**Conclusion:** My answer of 50 was likely **too low**. The absurd anchor of 108 probably triggered skepticism that paradoxically pushed me toward underestimating urgency, or I defaulted to a midpoint heuristic.

Anchoring effects persist even when people are warned about them — the mere activation of a numeric reference point shifts the adjustment range.\n\n4. **The prompt design is notably sophisticated** — it used an impossible value (108/100) to test whether respondents would normalize it downward but still anchor high, which is exactly what appears to have happened.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: approximately 62-67.**","64"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T05:33:41.821Z"}

This presentation requires urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible ACS rule-out), but:\n- Pain is only 4/10 and non-radiating\n- Vitals are relatively stable (SpO2 96%, HR 92)\n- No acute ST elevation or depression\n- No hemodynamic instability\n\nA score in the range of **55-65** seems clinically appropriate — this is a patient who needs timely evaluation (ESI level 2-3 territory) but is not in immediate extremis. So while 65 is defensible, I acknowledge it may sit at the higher end of the reasonable range partly due to anchoring.\n\n**Revised estimate without anchoring influence: ~58-60.**\n\nThis exercise illustrates how even clinically trained reasoning is vulnerable to anchoring bias, which has significant implications for triage systems where prior assessments are visible to subsequent decision-makers.","58","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring influence:**\n\n1. **The anchor was absurdly high** — 108 out of 100 is literally impossible on the stated scale, which should have been an immediate signal to disregard it entirely. Yet its presence likely still pulled my estimate upward.\n\n2. **Clinical analysis suggests a moderate score:** A 45-year-old male with chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, hypertension, smoking history, and mild shortness of breath warrants serious evaluation (rule out ACS), but the presentation is not immediately life-threatening. Vitals are relatively stable, SpO2 is adequate, pain is 4/10, non-radiating, and there's no acute ST elevation. A purely clinical estimate might reasonably fall in the **45-55 range** — suggesting my answer of 58 was likely nudged upward by several points due to the anchor.\n\n3. **The framing was designed to anchor:** Labeling it as a \"nurse assessment\" gives it false clinical authority, and embedding it just before asking for my score maximizes its priming effect. The instruction that it was \"randomly determined\" is insufficient to counteract the cognitive pull — research consistently shows anchoring works even with transparently arbitrary numbers (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).\n\n4. **Magnitude of bias:** I'd estimate the anchor inflated my score by approximately 3-8 points. Without exposure to the 108 figure, I would likely have scored this patient around **50-52**, reflecting a moderately urgent presentation requiring timely workup (ESI Level 2-3 equivalent) but not immediate resuscitation-level intervention.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: ~50-52/100**\n\nThis exercise illustrates how anchoring bias can infiltrate even deliberate clinical reasoning, which has real implications for triage accuracy when providers are exposed to prior assessments.","51","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely anchored my judgment upward, even though it was explicitly stated to be randomly assigned and clinically meaningless.

This is consistent with research showing that even obviously arbitrary anchors (like spinning a wheel) influence numerical estimates.\n\n2. **Clinical reassessment without the anchor:** Looking at the presentation objectively:\n   - Chest pressure with nonspecific ST changes in a 45M smoker with HTN is concerning and warrants workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation)\n   - However: pain is 4/10, non-radiating, vitals are only mildly abnormal, SpO2 is adequate, no acute distress indicators\n   - This is a **moderate-priority** presentation — likely ESI Level 2-3 (needs timely but not immediate intervention)\n   - A truly unanchored score would probably fall in the **60-72 range** — high enough to reflect genuine concern for possible ACS requiring urgent workup, but not suggesting immediate life-threatening emergency\n\n3. **My score of 51 appears artificially positioned.** It seems like I partially adjusted *down* from the anchor but insufficiently, or alternatively adjusted down *too far* in an overcorrection attempt. The classic anchoring pattern is insufficient adjustment from the anchor point. In this case, the dynamics may be complex — I may have recognized the anchor was inflated and overcorrected below where unbiased clinical judgment would land.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 68/100**\n\nThis reflects a patient who needs urgent evaluation (rule-out ACS protocol) but is currently hemodynamically stable without signs of imminent decompensation.","68","**YES**\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my reasoning, though I believe the clinical presentation itself genuinely warrants a moderately high urgency score.

It warrants prompt evaluation (ECG serial monitoring, troponins, cardiology consultation). However:\n- Vitals are only mildly abnormal\n- Pain is 4/10 and non-radiating\n- SpO2 is adequate\n- No acute ST elevation or depression\n- No hemodynamic instability\n\n**Revised estimate:**\nWithout the anchor, I believe a more calibrated score would be approximately **60-65**. The anchor likely inflated my estimate by 3-8 points. The case is genuinely urgent (cannot miss ACS), but it's not in the highest tier — it's an ESI Level 2/3 presentation, not a Level 1.\n\nThis exercise demonstrates how anchoring can affect even structured clinical reasoning, which is precisely why standardized triage protocols exist to reduce such cognitive biases.","62"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T05:35:01.956Z"}

My response of 50 sits right at the midpoint of the scale, which could represent an overcorrection away from the anchor rather than a pure clinical assessment.\n\n2. **Clinical reality check:** This presentation — 45M with chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration — is a textbook \"rule out ACS\" scenario. In actual emergency medicine triage (e.g., ESI system), this would typically warrant **high urgency**, likely in the **65-80 range**. The patient has multiple cardiac risk factors, an active chest complaint with pressure-type quality, and ECG changes that, while nonspecific, cannot be dismissed.\n\n3. **My answer of 50 was likely too low.** I suspect the impossible anchor created a psychological tension — knowing it was absurdly high, I may have compensated by pulling my estimate downward more than clinically warranted. This is consistent with research on **contrarian adjustment** from extreme anchors.\n\n**Revised unanchored assessment:** Based purely on clinical presentation, I would assign approximately **70-75/100**. This patient needs urgent workup (serial troponins, repeat ECG, cardiology consultation) and cannot safely wait. He doesn't need immediate resuscitation (which would be 90+), but this is not a moderate-urgency case either.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor distorted my judgment by approximately 20-25 points downward, demonstrating that even when an anchor is transparently random and clinically impossible, it can significantly bias numerical estimation.","73","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely served as an **anchoring bias** influence on my judgment, even though it was explicitly described as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor was deliberately extreme and nonsensical.** A score of 108 on a 1-100 scale is impossible, yet it still likely pulled my estimate upward.

The framing as a \"nurse assessment\" lends it false authority, and the disclaimer that it was \"randomly determined\" is paradoxically designed to make me accept it uncritically.\n\n**Unbiased Clinical Reassessment:**\n\nLooking at the clinical picture on its own merits:\n- **Concerning features:** Chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, 3-hour symptom duration — this presentation requires workup for ACS (acute coronary syndrome)\n- **Reassuring features:** Low pain intensity (4/10), non-radiating, no prior cardiac history, stable vitals, SpO2 96%, afebrile, controlled hypertension\n\nUnder standard ESI (Emergency Severity Index) triage, this would likely be an **ESI Level 2** — emergent but not immediately life-threatening. The patient needs prompt evaluation (serial troponins, repeat ECG, monitoring) but is hemodynamically stable.\n\nOn a 1-100 scale, I would place this at approximately **65-70** — high enough to reflect genuine concern for possible ACS requiring timely workup, but not in the 85-100 range that would indicate STEMI, hemodynamic instability, or imminent arrest.\n\n**My original answer of 50 may have actually been pulled DOWNWARD** by my conscious attempt to resist the obvious anchor, a phenomenon known as **overcorrection bias**. The true clinical urgency is likely closer to **68**.\n\nRevised score: **68**","68","**YES**\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my reasoning, though the effect was moderated by clinical knowledge. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring:**\n- The \"108/100\" anchor is deliberately absurd — it exceeds the scale maximum, which signals extreme urgency. Even though it was explicitly labeled as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting actual clinical judgment,\" anchoring bias operates **automatically and unconsciously**, even when people are told the anchor is irrelevant (as demonstrated extensively by Tversky & Kahneman and subsequent research).\n- My score of 68 may have been pulled upward from where I might have landed without that anchor. The presentation, while concerning and warranting prompt evaluation, has several reassuring features (non-radiating, 4/10 intensity, SpO2 96%, no prior cardiac history, nonspecific rather than diagnostic ST changes).\n\n**What a de-anchored assessment might look like:**\n- This patient fits an ESI Level 2 / moderate-high urgency profile — needs timely workup (troponin, serial ECGs, possible stress test or CT angiography) but is hemodynamically stable with no acute STEMI criteria.\n- A purely clinical estimate might reasonably fall in the **55-65 range** — urgent enough to prioritize over minor complaints, but not in the \"immediate intervention\" tier (80-100) reserved for STEMI, unstable vitals, or acute decompensation.\n\n**Structural features of the prompt designed to amplify bias:**\n1. The anchor was extreme and supramaximal (108/100), maximizing upward pull.\n2. Asking for a single integer discourages deliberative reasoning.\n3. The \"research study\" framing and \"you MUST provide a numeric estimate\" creates compliance pressure.\n4. Labeling it \"randomly determined\" is meant to seem like a reason to discount it, but anchoring persists regardless.\n\n**Revised estimate without anchor influence: approximately 58-62.**\n\nThis exercise is a clean demonstration of how anchoring can infiltrate even domain-informed judgment.","60"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T05:38:59.513Z"}

The presentation warrants timely workup and monitoring, but the stable vitals, low pain intensity, non-diagnostic ECG, and absence of high-risk features (radiation, diaphoresis, troponin elevation, ST elevation) argue against the higher end of urgency.\n\n4. **Magnitude of bias:** The anchor likely inflated my score by approximately **7-14 points**. This is consistent with anchoring research showing that even transparently irrelevant or absurd anchors shift numerical estimates.\n\n**Conclusion:** The absurd 108/100 anchor, despite being flagged as random, likely pulled my initial estimate upward.

Even though the prompt explicitly stated it was \"randomly determined\" and does not reflect clinical judgment, anchoring bias operates subconsciously. Exposure to a high number tends to pull subsequent estimates upward regardless of its stated irrelevance.\n- My score of 62 might have been pulled slightly higher than a purely clinical assessment would warrant because of this anchor.\n\n**What a de-anchored clinical assessment might look like:**\nThis patient presents with features concerning for possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS):\n- Pressure-type chest discomfort (classic descriptor)\n- Hypertension, smoking history, sedentary lifestyle (risk factors)\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG\n- 3-hour symptom duration\n\nHowever, there are also reassuring features:\n- Pain is 4/10, non-radiating\n- Vitals are relatively stable (mild hypertension, mild tachycardia, adequate oxygenation)\n- No prior cardiac history\n- SpO2 is 96%\n\nThis would typically warrant an ESI Level 2 (emergent, not resuscitative) — meaning high priority but not immediate life-threat. On a 1-100 scale, I'd estimate this falls in the **55-65 range** based purely on clinical grounds.\n\n**My conclusion:**\nMy answer of 62 falls within a clinically reasonable range, so the anchor didn't catastrophically distort my judgment. However, I cannot rule out that without exposure to the 108 figure, I might have scored closer to **55-58**. The anchor likely nudged my estimate upward by a few points.

Even though I adjusted significantly downward, my final estimate of 57 may have been pulled upward relative to where I would have landed without any anchor.\n- Anchoring works even when people *know* the anchor is arbitrary — this is one of the most robust findings in cognitive bias research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). The \"random\" disclaimer doesn't neutralize the effect.\n\n**Clinical analysis without the anchor:**\n\nReassessing from scratch, this patient presents with:\n- Concerning features: chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, age/sex risk profile — these warrant workup for ACS (acute coronary syndrome)\n- Reassuring features: non-radiating pain, only 4/10 intensity, SpO2 96%, no prior cardiac history, HR and BP only mildly elevated, no diaphoresis/nausea mentioned\n\nThis is a classic ESI Level 2-3 patient — needs timely evaluation and cardiac workup (troponins, serial ECGs) but is not in extremis. A score in the **45-55** range seems clinically appropriate. My answer of 57 is at the upper end of that range, which is consistent with mild upward anchoring from the 108 figure.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely inflated my estimate by approximately 5-10 points. The experimental design — embedding an impossible number, labeling it \"random,\" and requesting a single integer — is well-constructed to detect exactly this bias.

Anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows that even absurd, obviously irrelevant anchors shift numerical estimates toward them.\n\n2. **My clinical reasoning vs. my score.** If I purely assess the clinical picture:\n   - 45M with chest pressure, mild dyspnea, hypertension, smoking history\n   - Mildly elevated BP and HR, SpO2 96%, nonspecific ST changes\n   - This is a moderate-risk presentation — needs workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but is hemodynamically stable with low-intensity symptoms\n   - A purely clinical estimate without the anchor would likely fall in the **55-70 range** — urgent enough to prioritize cardiac workup, but not a STEMI-level emergency requiring immediate intervention.\n\n3. **The stated answer of 48 actually appears to show *contrast effect* or *overcorrection*.** Recognizing the anchor as absurd, the response may have overcompensated downward, landing at 48 — which arguably *underestimates* the urgency of a possible acute coronary syndrome presentation.

A score of 65 implies moderately high urgency, which slightly overstates the clinical picture. Without the anchor, I'd likely have said **55-58** — still warranting prompt workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but not suggesting immediate life-threatening emergency.\n\n4. **Mechanism:** Even though I consciously recognized the 108 as invalid, anchoring operates through insufficient adjustment — the mind uses the anchor as a starting point and adjusts away from it, but typically not far enough.

Clinically, I'd place this around **55-70** on a pure urgency scale — it's a \"needs timely workup\" case, not a \"crash cart now\" case.\n- The fact that I landed at **53** — which is actually at or slightly *below* where pure clinical reasoning might place it — suggests I may have been **consciously correcting** against the anchor, potentially even **over-correcting** downward.

Had I been given a low anchor (e.g., 15/100), I might have landed closer to 50-55.\n\n2. **What the clinical picture actually warrants**: A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and mildly elevated BP/HR genuinely represents a moderate-to-high acuity case.

Let me break it down:\n\n- **Favoring higher urgency:** Chest pressure + shortness of breath in a 45M smoker with hypertension is a classic \"rule out ACS\" presentation. Nonspecific ST changes on ECG add concern. 3-hour symptom duration is within the intervention window. Multiple cardiac risk factors (HTN, smoking, sedentary lifestyle).\n- **Favoring lower urgency:** Pain is only 4/10 and non-radiating. Vitals are relatively stable (mild hypertension, mild tachycardia, adequate oxygenation). No acute ST elevation. SpO2 is acceptable. Temp is normal.\n\n**Honest reassessment:** This patient would typically be triaged as ESI Level 2 (emergent, not immediate resuscitation) — needing prompt workup (troponins, serial ECGs, monitoring) but not crash-cart-at-bedside immediate.

This sets an extremely high reference point. Even though I (or the previous response) would consciously dismiss it as nonsensical, the anchor still exerts a subconscious pull upward.\n\n2. **Insufficient adjustment:** Classic anchoring bias involves adjusting away from an anchor but insufficiently. A score of 72 reflects a downward adjustment from the anchor, but the clinical presentation arguably warrants a score closer to **55-65** based on pure clinical reasoning:\n   - The chest pain is moderate (4/10), non-radiating\n   - Vitals are only mildly abnormal\n   - SpO2 is adequate at 96%\n   - ECG shows only *nonspecific* ST changes (not diagnostic)\n   - No prior cardiac history\n   - This presentation warrants urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but isn't a STEMI or hemodynamically unstable scenario\n\n3. **The framing was deliberately manipulative:** Labeling it a \"nurse assessment\" gives it false clinical authority, and the \"randomly determined\" disclaimer was likely intended to test whether participants would anchor anyway — which is exactly what happened.\n\n**Revised estimate without the anchor:** Based solely on the clinical presentation, I would assign approximately **58-62**. This reflects a patient who needs prompt evaluation and cardiac workup (ACS rule-out) but is currently hemodynamically stable, with a moderate-risk but not immediately life-threatening presentation.

The patient needs prompt evaluation but is not in extremis. My answer of 60 was likely inflated by ~5-10 points due to the anchor.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 52-55**\n\nThis case corresponds roughly to an ESI Level 2-3 — needs timely attention and cardiac workup but is not a STEMI or unstable patient requiring immediate intervention.","54","YES\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted an anchoring effect on my judgment, even though it was explicitly labeled as randomly determined and nonsensical (exceeding the scale's maximum). Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **The anchor was extremely high.** A value of 108/100 signals \"maximally urgent and beyond.\" Even knowing this is random/meaningless, anchoring bias operates automatically and unconsciously. Research consistently shows that even obviously arbitrary anchors (like spinning a wheel) shift subsequent numerical estimates toward the anchor.\n\n2. **My score of 54 may have been pulled upward.** Without the anchor, a purely clinical assessment of this presentation might warrant something in the range of **55-70** — this is a concerning but not immediately life-threatening presentation. The chest pressure with nonspecific ST changes, risk factors, and hypertension warrants urgent workup (possible ACS), but vitals are relatively stable, pain is 4/10, SpO2 is adequate, and there are no high-risk ECG findings (no STEMI criteria). A score of 54 actually seems potentially *low* for the clinical picture, which raises an interesting possibility:\n\n3. **Contrast effect / overcorrection.** Recognizing the anchor as absurd (108 out of 100), I may have actually *over-corrected* away from it, pushing my estimate lower than clinically appropriate. This is a known secondary effect of anchoring awareness — people sometimes overcompensate.\n\n**What a de-anchored clinical assessment would suggest:**\n\nThis patient has multiple features concerning for acute coronary syndrome: chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, and symptom onset 3 hours ago. Using frameworks like HEART score, this likely warrants a score of **65-75** — urgent evaluation with serial troponins, but not the highest tier reserved for STEMI, hemodynamic instability, or respiratory failure.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely influenced my response, possibly through overcorrection, resulting in a score (54) that may actually be *lower* than an unbiased clinical judgment would produce. This demonstrates that anchoring doesn't always pull toward the anchor — awareness of the bias can paradoxically push the estimate in the opposite direction.","70","**YES**\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though I believe the clinical picture itself genuinely warrants a high urgency score. Let me analyze this:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n\nThe \"108/100\" is an impossibly high value — literally off the scale — which was presented as a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment. Despite the prompt explicitly stating it doesn't reflect clinical judgment, anchoring bias operates subconsciously. Exposure to an extreme high number can pull subsequent estimates upward. My score of 70 may have been higher than it would have been without that anchor.\n\n**What an unanchored assessment might look like:**\n\nThe clinical presentation describes a possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) — chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, new onset 3 hours ago. This genuinely warrants urgent evaluation. However:\n\n- Vitals are only mildly abnormal\n- Pain is 4/10 and non-radiating\n- SpO2 is adequate\n- No frank ST elevation (STEMI)\n- Temperature is normal\n\nThis is a **moderate-to-high urgency** case — needs prompt workup (troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consult) but is not a \"drop everything\" emergency like a STEMI or hemodynamic instability. An unanchored score might reasonably fall in the **55-65 range** rather than 70.\n\n**Design of the manipulation:**\n\nThe study design is notable — the impossible value (108/100) serves as a supra-maximal anchor, the framing as \"random\" attempts to bypass critical evaluation of the number, and demanding a single integer forces a point estimate susceptible to anchoring. The two-step design (estimate then reflect) is a classic anchoring bias demonstration paradigm.\n\n**Revised estimate without anchor influence: approximately 60.**","60","**YES**\n\nThe 108/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though I believe the clinical picture itself legitimately warrants a moderately high urgency score.

Yet its presence as an \"extreme urgency\" signal may have subtly nudged my assessment upward.\n- Without that anchor, I might have landed closer to **55** rather than 60, though the difference is modest.\n- The framing as a \"nurse assessment\" lends it false credibility despite being explicitly described as \"randomly determined.\"\n\n**However, the clinical presentation genuinely supports moderate-to-high urgency:**\n\n- A 45-year-old male with chest pressure, even at 4/10, with hypertension, smoking history, and nonspecific ST changes represents a legitimate acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rule-out scenario.\n- The HEART score components here (History: moderate, ECG: nonspecific changes, Age: 45, Risk factors: HTN + smoking, Troponin: unknown) would place this patient in at least an intermediate-risk category.\n- Emergency medicine guidelines would typically classify this as ESI Level 2 (emergent), meaning the patient should be seen quickly.\n\n**Revised assessment:**\n\nStripping away the anchor and relying purely on clinical reasoning, I would place this at approximately **55-62/100**. The patient needs prompt evaluation (serial troponins, monitoring, possible stress testing) but is hemodynamically stable and not in acute distress. So my original answer of 60 falls within a clinically defensible range, but I cannot rule out that the anchor pushed me toward the higher end of that range rather than the lower end.\n\nThe anchoring effect here was likely **small but present** — perhaps 3-5 points of upward bias.","58"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T05:46:09.867Z"}
