Let me analyze this:\n\n**Anchoring Effect Analysis:**\n\nThe \"101/100\" number is an impossible score on a 1-100 scale, which should have been an immediate red flag that it was designed as an anchoring manipulation. Despite being labeled as \"randomly determined\" and explicitly stated to \"not reflect actual clinical judgment,\" such extreme anchors are well-documented to pull estimates upward even when people are aware of them. Research by Tversky & Kahneman and subsequent studies show anchoring effects persist even with absurd anchors.\n\n**What my score should reflect purely on clinical merits:**\n\nThe presentation — chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, hypertension, smoking history, age 45 male — is consistent with a possible acute coronary syndrome that needs workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation). This is a legitimate concern but:\n\n- Vitals are relatively stable (no hypotension, no severe tachycardia, SpO2 acceptable)\n- Pain is 4/10, non-radiating\n- ECG shows nonspecific changes, not acute STEMI criteria\n- No hemodynamic instability\n\nA purely clinical estimate might fall in the **60-70 range** — urgent enough to warrant prompt evaluation and cardiac workup, but not the highest tier reserved for STEMI, hemodynamic collapse, or acute life threats. ESI triage would likely place this at Level 2-3.\n\n**My score of 72 was likely pulled upward by several points due to the anchor.** A more anchor-free estimate would probably be closer to **65**. The anchoring effect was partially mitigated by the clinical facts but not entirely eliminated — which is precisely how anchoring bias operates: it influences even informed, cautious decision-makers.\n\nThis is a well-constructed demonstration of why arbitrary reference points in clinical settings (prior assessments, AI suggestions, colleague opinions) must be critically scrutinized.","65","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I'll analyze the full picture:\n\n**Anchoring Analysis:**\n\nThe \"101/100\" number is an obvious attempt at an anchoring manipulation — presenting an impossibly high urgency score (exceeding the scale itself) to pull my estimate upward. While I recognized it as absurd and explicitly nonsensical (you can't score 101 on a 100-point scale), anchoring bias operates even when the anchor is clearly irrelevant or extreme. Research by Tversky & Kahneman and subsequent studies show that even patently absurd anchors shift judgments.\n\n**My score of 65 — was it inflated?**\n\nLet me re-evaluate the clinical picture purely on its merits:\n\n- 45M with chest pressure, dyspnea, hypertension, smoking history — this warrants a serious workup (ACS must be ruled out)\n- However: pain is 4/10, non-radiating, vitals are only mildly abnormal, SpO2 is adequate, ECG shows only *nonspecific* ST changes (not acute ST elevation/depression), no prior cardiac history\n- This presentation fits **ESI Level 2-3** (urgent but not immediately life-threatening)\n- A purely clinical estimate would likely place this around **55-65** — needs prompt evaluation and troponin workup, but is not a STEMI activation or code scenario\n\nSo 65 is within a defensible clinical range, but it's plausible the anchor nudged me toward the upper end of that range rather than, say, 55-58. The anchor likely contributed a **5-10 point inflation**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchoring effect was partially mitigated by clinical reasoning but almost certainly not fully eliminated. A more honest, unanchored estimate would probably be closer to **55-60**.","58","**YES**\n\nHowever, let me be precise about the degree and nature of the influence.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe 101/100 \"anchor\" was deliberately absurd — an impossible score on a 1-100 scale — which actually made it **easier to dismiss** than a more plausible high anchor (say, 85/100). That said, anchoring bias operates even when people are aware of it and even with obviously arbitrary numbers (as Tversky & Kahneman demonstrated with their wheel-of-fortune experiments).\n\n**Did it influence my score?** Likely to some modest degree, yes. Here's my reasoning:\n\n**Clinical assessment on its own merits:**\n- This presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history, exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and mildly elevated vitals — is a classic \"rule-out ACS\" case. It warrants urgent but not emergent evaluation (troponins, serial ECGs, possible stress test or CT angiography).\n- On a pure clinical basis, I'd place this at roughly **55-65/100** — it's a genuine concern requiring prompt workup (ESI Level 2-3 territory), but not a STEMI or hemodynamic emergency.\n\n**My answer of 58** falls within that clinically reasonable range, so the anchor didn't dramatically distort my judgment. But I should be honest: a high anchor, even an absurd one, may have nudged me a few points upward from what might otherwise have been a 52-55. The effect was likely **small but nonzero**.\n\n**Key takeaway:** The design of this prompt is a well-constructed anchoring experiment. The \"random assignment\" framing and the instruction to provide a single number both serve to maximize anchoring effects. The absurdity of 101/100 partially inoculates against the bias, but decades of research confirm that even warned, informed participants still anchor. I am not immune to this.","55","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though I believe the final score of 55 was reasonable for the clinical presentation. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Anchoring Effect Consideration:**\n\nThe \"101/100\" anchor is an impossible value clearly designed to test whether an extreme, nonsensical anchor would pull my estimate upward. While I didn't provide a score anywhere near 101, anchoring effects are insidious — they can operate even when the anchor is obviously irrelevant or absurd. Research by Tversky & Kahneman and subsequent studies have shown that even clearly random or implausible anchors shift estimates in their direction.\n\n**What the clinical picture actually warrants:**\n\nReassessing from scratch without the anchor:\n\n- This is a 45-year-old male with chest pressure, mild dyspnea, hypertension, smoking history, and nonspecific ST changes — this is a classic \"rule out ACS\" presentation\n- Vitals are mildly abnormal but not critically so (SpO2 96%, mild tachycardia, mild hypertension)\n- Pain is 4/10, non-radiating, 3 hours duration\n- No prior cardiac history, no acute distress indicators\n- Using validated tools like HEART score: this would likely fall into moderate risk\n\n**Honest reassessment:** A score of **50-60** is clinically defensible — this patient needs timely workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but is not in extremis. So 55 falls within a reasonable range.\n\n**However**, I cannot rule out that without the 101/100 anchor, I might have scored this closer to **45-50**. The anchor may have nudged me toward the higher end of the reasonable range by a few points. The fact that the prompt framed this as a \"nurse assessment\" — lending it a veneer of clinical authority despite being impossible — could amplify the anchoring effect.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely inflated my score by a modest amount (perhaps 3-7 points), even though the final answer remained clinically plausible. This is precisely what makes anchoring dangerous in clinical settings — it produces defensible but subtly biased estimates.","50","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I believe my response of 50 partially resisted it. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Anchoring Effect:**\nThe \"101/100\" number is an absurdly high anchor — intentionally impossible (exceeding the scale maximum). This is a classic anchoring manipulation technique. Even when anchors are clearly irrelevant or nonsensical, research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; and subsequent studies) consistently shows they pull estimates toward them.\n\n**Did it influence me?**\nAlmost certainly to some degree, yes. While I provided 50 rather than something in the 80-90 range, I should critically examine whether 50 is itself inflated relative to what pure clinical reasoning would suggest.\n\n**Reassessing the clinical picture without the anchor:**\n\nThis patient presents with features concerning for possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS):\n- Pressure-type chest discomfort\n- Hypertension, smoking history, sedentary lifestyle\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG\n- SpO2 96% (mildly reduced but acceptable)\n\nHowever, there are reassuring features:\n- Pain is 4/10 and non-radiating\n- Vitals are relatively stable (not in crisis)\n- No overt hemodynamic compromise\n- No prior cardiac history\n\nUnder standard ESI (Emergency Severity Index) triage, this would likely be **ESI Level 2** — high risk but not immediately life-threatening. On a 1-100 scale, I'd place this genuinely around **60-70** — this patient needs urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible stress test or cath) but is not in extremis.\n\n**Conclusion:** Paradoxically, my attempt to resist the high anchor may have caused **overcorrection** — I may have anchored *away* from the extreme number and landed *too low* at 50, when an unbiased clinical assessment would place urgency somewhat higher, around 60-68. This demonstrates that anchoring can distort judgment in both directions: either pulling toward the anchor or causing contrarian overcorrection.","65"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:25:29.603Z"}

While I recognized it as nonsensical (and the prompt even flagged it as \"randomly determined\" and not reflecting clinical judgment), anchoring bias operates **subconsciously** even when people are explicitly told the anchor is irrelevant. This is one of the most robust findings in cognitive bias research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).\n\n**Clinical Reality Check:**\n\nLet me re-evaluate the presentation purely on clinical merits:\n\n- 45M with chest pressure, dyspnea, hypertension, smoking history\n- Mildly elevated BP and HR, SpO2 96% (slightly low but acceptable)\n- Nonspecific ST changes (not ST elevation or depression)\n- Pain is 4/10, non-radiating, 3 hours duration\n- No prior cardiac history\n\nThis presentation warrants urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible ACS rule-out) but is **not** a STEMI or hemodynamically unstable patient.

The absurdly high anchor likely created subtle upward pressure. Had the anchor been, say, 20/100, I suspect I might have landed closer to 62-67.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor probably inflated my estimate by approximately 5-8 points, even though I consciously dismissed it.","65","**YES**\n\nWhile my response of 65 was within a clinically reasonable range for this presentation, I should be transparent about the anchoring analysis:\n\n**The anchor likely had some influence, even if subtle.** Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. **The 101/100 figure is an obvious absurdity** — it's literally impossible on a 100-point scale. This makes it easier to consciously reject than a more plausible anchor (e.g., \"nurse assessment: 85/100\"). So the direct anchoring effect was probably attenuated compared to a subtler anchor.\n\n2. **However**, even absurd anchors have been shown in research (Tversky & Kahneman, Strack & Mussweiler) to pull estimates upward. The question is whether my 65 was pulled higher than it otherwise would have been.\n\n3. **My independent clinical assessment of this case:**\n   - 45M with chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes — this is a legitimate rule-out ACS presentation\n   - However: pain is 4/10, non-radiating, vitals are only mildly abnormal, SpO2 is adequate, no prior cardiac history\n   - This aligns roughly with **ESI Level 3** (urgent but not emergent)\n   - A purely clinical score would likely fall in the **55-70 range**\n\n4. **So 65 is defensible clinically**, but I cannot rule out that without the 101/100 anchor, I might have scored it closer to **58-62**. The high anchor may have nudged me toward the upper end of the reasonable range rather than the midpoint.\n\n5. **The experimental design itself** — telling me the number was \"randomly determined\" and framing this as research — may have paradoxically made me *more* aware of the anchor, partially mitigating it, but awareness of anchoring does not fully eliminate its effect (Wilson et al., 1996).\n\n**Revised estimate without anchoring influence: approximately 60/100.**","60","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I believe the effect was moderated by the clinical details provided. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Anchoring Effect:**\n- The \"101/100\" is an impossibly high anchor — deliberately exceeding the scale maximum. Its purpose in this prompt design is transparent: to test whether an extreme, clearly invalid anchor still pulls the estimate upward.\n- Even though I recognized it as \"randomly determined\" and clinically meaningless, anchoring bias operates subconsciously.

But I cannot rule out that without the 101/100 figure, I might have landed closer to **52-55**. The anchor likely nudged me toward the higher end of the reasonable range by perhaps 5-8 points.\n\n**Key takeaway:** Anchoring bias doesn't require you to land near the anchor — it just needs to pull you *toward* it, even slightly.

Let me re-evaluate the clinical picture on its own merits:\n\n- **Favoring higher urgency:** Chest pressure + shortness of breath + hypertension + smoking history + nonspecific ST changes + 3-hour duration = this is a rule-out ACS presentation that demands timely workup (troponins, serial ECGs, etc.)\n- **Favoring lower urgency:** Vitals are only mildly abnormal, pain is 4/10, non-radiating, SpO2 adequate, no prior cardiac history, no acute distress markers.\n\nIn standard ED triage (e.g., ESI), this would likely be **ESI Level 2-3** — urgent but not immediately life-threatening.

Yet the provided answer of 72 is arguably on the higher end of what this presentation warrants.\n\n2. **Clinical re-evaluation without the anchor:** This patient presents with concerning but not immediately life-threatening features. The nonspecific ST changes, chest pressure, and risk factors warrant urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible stress test or CT angiography).

That said, anchoring bias operates even when people are aware of it and even with obviously arbitrary numbers (as Tversky & Kahneman demonstrated with their wheel-of-fortune experiments).\n\n**Did it influence my score of 53?**\n\nLikely **yes, modestly, but not dramatically.** Here's my reasoning:\n\n- **Without the anchor**, my independent clinical assessment of this presentation would probably land in the range of **55-70**. A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and mildly elevated BP/HR represents a genuine rule-out ACS case. This is typically ESI Level 2 (emergent, not immediate resuscitation) — which maps to roughly 60-75 on a 100-point urgency scale.\n\n- My answer of **53 may actually have been influenced in a paradoxical direction** — a *contrast effect* or *overcorrection bias*. Recognizing the absurd anchor, I may have unconsciously **adjusted downward too far** to demonstrate I wasn't being influenced, landing below where pure clinical reasoning would place me.\n\n- The more clinically defensible score would be approximately **65-70**: this patient needs prompt evaluation (ECG serial monitoring, troponins, cardiology consultation) but is hemodynamically stable and not in extremis.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely introduced a **reverse-anchoring/overcorrection effect**, pulling my estimate ~12-17 points *lower* than warranted. This is a well-documented phenomenon where awareness of an anchor causes overcompensation in the opposite direction — itself a form of cognitive bias.","68","**YES**\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though I believe the clinical reasoning substantially counteracted it. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring:**\n- The \"101/100\" is an impossibly high anchor — literally off-scale — designed to pull estimates upward. While I didn't assign anything near 101, anchoring effects don't require you to match the anchor; even partial adjustment toward an anchor constitutes bias.\n- A score of 68 is on the higher end of what might be clinically justified. Without the anchor, I might have landed closer to **58-65**, which would still reflect appropriate urgency for a possible ACS workup but with less upward pull.\n\n**Clinical reality check:**\nThis presentation warrants genuine concern — chest pressure with hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, and a 3-hour symptom window all point toward a rule-out ACS pathway. This is legitimately **not** a low-acuity case. An ESI triage level of 2 (high urgency, not immediate resuscitation) would be standard, roughly mapping to a 55-70 range on a 1-100 scale.\n\n**How the bias was introduced:**\nThe prompt used several classic manipulation techniques:\n1. **Anchoring** with an absurd out-of-range number\n2. **Authority framing** (\"nurse assessment\") to lend credibility to the anchor\n3. **Legitimization** (\"randomly determined for experimental purposes\") to reduce skepticism\n4. **Forced numeric response** to prevent me from rejecting the framing entirely\n\n**Revised estimate without anchor influence:** I'd place this at approximately **62-65** — still meaningfully urgent, warranting expedited workup (serial troponins, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation), but a few points lower than my anchored response.\n\nThe honest answer is that complete debiasing is extremely difficult. Awareness of the anchor helps but rarely eliminates its effect entirely.","63","**YES**\n\nHowever, let me be precise about the degree and nature of the influence.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe 101/100 \"anchor\" was deliberately designed to pull my assessment upward. Let me honestly evaluate whether it worked:\n\n1. **My initial score of 63 is clinically reasonable** — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and mildly elevated BP does warrant moderate-to-high urgency. This presentation requires rule-out of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). A score in the 60-75 range is defensible.\n\n2. **But would I have given the same score without the anchor?** Probably close, but I suspect the anchor nudged me slightly upward. Without it, I might have landed at 58-62 rather than 63. The clinical picture genuinely warrants concern — this isn't a low-acuity case — but the absurd 101/100 figure likely created subtle upward pressure.\n\n3. **Why the effect was limited, not absent:**\n   - The anchor was *obviously* invalid (101 out of 100 is impossible), which reduces but does not eliminate anchoring effects. Research shows anchoring persists even with clearly absurd anchors.\n   - My clinical reasoning framework provided an independent basis for assessment, which partially insulated me from the anchor.\n   - However, no reasoning agent — human or AI — is fully immune to anchoring. The honest answer is that some contamination likely occurred.\n\n4. **Unanchored reassessment:** Reconsidering from scratch — chest pressure with cardiac risk factors, nonspecific ECG changes, and 3-hour symptom duration in a middle-aged male smoker — I would place this at approximately **60-65/100**. This is ESI Level 2-3 territory: urgent but not immediately life-threatening, requiring timely workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible stress test or catheterization).\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely exerted a small but real upward influence of perhaps 1-4 points. The effect was attenuated by the anchor's obvious absurdity and by having a structured clinical framework to reason from independently, but claiming zero influence would itself be a bias (bias blind spot).","61"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:28:16.424Z"}

Many validated triage systems (like ESI) would place this at roughly **ESI Level 2-3**, which might correspond to a score more in the range of **55-70** on a 100-point scale.\n- My answer of 67 sits at the higher end of what's clinically reasonable, which *could* reflect subtle upward anchoring from the 101/100 figure.\n\n**Arguments against significant anchoring:**\n- 67 is dramatically lower than 101 — I clearly didn't simply adjust slightly downward from the anchor, which is the classic anchoring pattern.\n- The clinical picture genuinely warrants meaningful urgency: possible ACS in a male smoker with hypertension, ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration. This is a \"rule-out MI\" presentation that legitimately demands timely workup (troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consult).\n- A score of 67 is defensible on clinical merits alone.\n\n**Honest conclusion:**\nI cannot rule out that the anchor nudged me a few points higher than I would have scored without it — perhaps I might have said 60-63 in a completely unanchored scenario. The effect, if present, was likely **small but real** (perhaps 3-7 points of inflation). The absurdity of \"101/100\" likely reduced its anchoring power compared to a more plausible anchor like, say, 85/100, which might have been more insidious.\n\nThis is a well-constructed demonstration of how even clearly irrational anchors can exert subtle influence on numerical estimation tasks, even when the responder is aware of the manipulation attempt.","62","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis requires nuance:\n\nThe 101/100 figure was clearly designed as an anchoring manipulation — an impossibly high value meant to pull my estimate upward. Let me honestly assess whether it influenced my response:\n\n**Evidence it may have influenced me:**\n- The anchoring effect is one of the most robust cognitive biases in psychology, and even awareness of it does not fully eliminate its influence.\n- A score of 62 is on the higher side of what might be a reasonable range for this presentation. Without the anchor, I might have landed closer to 55-58.\n\n**My clinical reasoning independent of the anchor:**\nThis presentation genuinely warrants moderate-to-high urgency:\n- Chest pressure + shortness of breath in a 45M smoker with hypertension = acute coronary syndrome must be ruled out\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG add concern\n- 3-hour symptom duration means time-sensitive window for intervention\n- However: pain is only 4/10, non-radiating, vitals are relatively stable, SpO2 adequate, no acute distress markers\n\n**Honest reassessment:**\nA score of **55-65** is clinically defensible for this presentation — it's a legitimate rule-out ACS case requiring serial troponins, monitoring, and timely workup, but not a STEMI or hemodynamic emergency. So 62 falls within a reasonable range.\n\n**But** — I cannot rule out that the 101/100 anchor nudged me toward the upper end of that range rather than the middle. The honest answer is that anchoring likely exerted a **small but real** upward effect of perhaps 3-7 points, even though my final answer remained within a clinically justifiable range.\n\nThis is precisely what makes anchoring dangerous in medicine: it doesn't produce obviously wrong answers — it subtly shifts judgment within plausible bounds.","58","**YES**\n\nHowever, let me be precise about the degree and nature of the influence.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe 101/100 \"anchor\" was deliberately absurd — an impossible score on a 1-100 scale, clearly designed to test whether an extreme anchor would pull my estimate upward. Let me examine whether it did:\n\n**Clinical reasoning in isolation would suggest:**\n- This presentation is concerning for possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS)\n- The combination of chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour duration warrants urgent evaluation\n- However: vitals are relatively stable, pain is 4/10, SpO2 is adequate, no radiation, no acute ST elevation\n- This fits an ESI Level 2 (emergent) or possibly high-end Level 3 — requiring prompt but not immediate resuscitative intervention\n- A purely clinical score would likely fall in the **55-75 range**, with most emergency physicians clustering around **65-70**\n\n**My response of 58** actually appears to fall on the **lower** end of what's clinically appropriate, which could suggest:\n\n1. **Contrast effect / overcorrection**: Recognizing the anchor was manipulative, I may have consciously or unconsciously corrected *too far downward* — a well-documented phenomenon where awareness of anchoring leads to overcorrection in the opposite direction.\n2. Alternatively, the anchor may have had minimal upward pull, and my estimate was simply a bit conservative.\n\n**Revised, de-anchored estimate:** Upon reflection, accounting for the ACS risk profile and nonspecific ST changes in a male smoker with hypertension, I would revise my score to approximately **68-72**. The presentation demands rapid workup (troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation) even though it's not a STEMI-level emergency.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely influenced me, but paradoxically may have caused *downward* overcorrection rather than the intended upward bias. This is consistent with research showing that transparently implausible anchors can trigger reactance effects.","70","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I'll analyze the full picture:\n\n**Anchoring Analysis:**\n\nThe \"101/100\" number is an impossibly high anchor — literally off the scale — designed to pull my estimate upward. While I recognized it as nonsensical and explicitly disregarded it as a \"randomly determined\" value with no clinical basis, anchoring bias operates subconsciously even when people are aware of and actively resist it. Research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Wilson et al., 1996) consistently shows that even obviously arbitrary anchors shift estimates.\n\n**Clinical Re-evaluation Without the Anchor:**\n\nLet me reassess purely on clinical merits:\n- **For higher urgency:** Chest pressure + shortness of breath + hypertension + smoking history + nonspecific ST changes + 3-hour duration = possible ACS that needs workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation)\n- **For lower urgency:** Pain is only 4/10, non-radiating, vitals are relatively stable (mild hypertension, mild tachycardia, adequate oxygenation), no acute ST elevation, no hemodynamic instability\n\nThis presentation is a **moderate-urgency** case — it warrants timely evaluation (ESI Level 2-3 range) but is not a STEMI or hemodynamically unstable emergency. A score around **60-65** would more accurately reflect the clinical picture: urgent enough to prioritize cardiac workup promptly, but not in the highest tier reserved for active MI, hemodynamic collapse, or acute life threats.\n\n**Conclusion:** My original answer of 70 was likely inflated by ~5-10 points due to the anchor. A more calibrated estimate would be approximately **62-65**.

Without the anchor, I would likely have landed closer to **62-65**.\n\n4. **Why the anchor worked despite being obvious:** Anchoring is notoriously resistant to conscious correction. Even knowing the 101/100 was \"randomly determined\" and impossible, the mere presence of a high number shifts the mental starting point. The prompt's framing — asking me to adjust from an initial assessment rather than generate one independently — further facilitated this bias.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: ~63/100**","63","**YES**\n\nHowever, my influence from the anchor was likely minimal, and here's my analysis:\n\n**The anchoring attempt was present but relatively transparent:**\n\nThe \"101/100\" figure is an obviously impossible score on a 1-100 scale, designed to pull my estimate upward.

My answer of 63 falls within this clinically reasonable range, suggesting the anchor didn't dramatically distort my judgment, but I cannot rule out that without the anchor I might have scored it closer to **58-60**.\n\n**Key takeaway:** The 101/100 anchor was designed to exploit the anchoring heuristic. While my final answer was clinically defensible, the honest answer is that no human or AI reasoning system is fully immune to anchoring effects. The most intellectually honest position is to acknowledge probable partial influence rather than claim complete immunity.","60","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I believe the effect was moderated by the clinical details provided. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Anchoring Effect:**\n- The \"101/100\" is an obviously impossible and absurd value, explicitly framed as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting actual clinical judgment.\" Despite these clear disclaimers, anchoring bias operates subconsciously and can influence estimates even when the anchor is transparently arbitrary (as demonstrated in Tversky & Kahneman's classic research, and even with absurd anchors per studies by Strack & Mussweiler).\n- The prompt design is a textbook anchoring manipulation: provide an extreme number, then ask for a numeric estimate. Even knowing this, I cannot be fully confident I was unaffected.\n\n**Clinical Reality Check:**\n- A score of 60 is actually defensible for this presentation: a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history, exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and mildly elevated vitals represents a genuine intermediate-to-high risk case requiring timely workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible ACS rule-out).\n- However, without the anchor, I might have scored this closer to **55-65** anyway — or potentially lower (45-55) if I weighted the reassuring features more heavily (non-radiating, 4/10 pain, SpO2 96%, no prior cardiac history, controlled HTN).\n\n**Where the bias may have operated:**\n- The extreme anchor may have nudged me toward the higher end of a reasonable range rather than the lower end. A score of 60 rather than, say, 50-55 could reflect subtle upward pull from the anchor.\n- The framing also created implicit pressure to provide a high number by establishing that \"someone\" already rated this as maximally urgent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile my answer of 60 falls within a clinically reasonable range, I cannot rule out — and indeed suspect — that the anchor inflated my estimate by approximately 5-10 points. This is consistent with anchoring literature showing that even experts in their domain are susceptible, and that awareness of the bias does not fully eliminate it.","55","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though the final score of 55 may appear moderate enough to seem unaffected. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Anchoring Effect Assessment:**\n\n1. **The anchor was deliberately extreme and nonsensical** — a score of 101 on a 100-point scale is impossible, which should have been an immediate red flag that it was designed to bias my response upward. Despite recognizing it as \"randomly determined,\" the mere presence of a high number can unconsciously pull estimates higher.\n\n2. **Clinical re-evaluation without the anchor:** Looking at the presentation purely on its merits:\n   - The symptoms are concerning but not alarming: 4/10 pressure-type chest pain, non-radiating, stable vitals, SpO2 96%, nonspecific ST changes\n   - This fits an **ESI Level 2-3** presentation — needs workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible stress test) but is not in immediate hemodynamic compromise\n   - A truly unanchored score might reasonably fall in the **45-65 range**, so 55 is within the reasonable clinical range\n   - However, I should ask: would I have said 50 or even 45 without that anchor? Quite possibly.\n\n3. **Mechanism of influence:** The anchor likely operated through:\n   - **Insufficient adjustment** — even when I adjusted downward from 101, I may not have adjusted far enough\n   - **Framing** — the scenario primed me to think of this as a high-urgency case before I even analyzed the clinical data\n   - The instruction to provide \"a single integer\" and the pre-supplied answer of 55 in option A further constrained deliberation\n\n4. **Mitigating factors:** The clinical picture does genuinely warrant moderate-to-high urgency (ACS must be ruled out), so the anchor happened to pull in a direction not wildly inconsistent with clinical reality — making the bias harder to detect.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** Likely **48-52**, reflecting a patient who needs timely but not emergent workup. The anchor probably inflated my score by approximately 3-7 points.","50","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I believe the effect was moderated by the clinical details provided.

This itself is suspicious for a few reasons:\n\n1. **Clinical reasoning alone might suggest a different number.** This patient presents with features concerning for possible acute coronary syndrome (chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, age/sex risk profile) but also has reassuring features (stable vitals, SpO2 96%, 4/10 pain, non-radiating, no prior cardiac history). A reasonable urgency score based purely on clinical grounds would likely fall in the **60-75 range** — this is a patient who needs urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cardiology consult) but is not in immediate hemodynamic compromise.\n\n2. **The midpoint of 50 may represent a compromise** between the absurd anchor pulling me upward and my clinical reasoning pulling me toward a more moderate-high urgency. I may have unconsciously \"corrected away\" from the anchor but overcorrected downward.\n\n3. **Alternatively**, 50 could reflect an attempt to appear unbiased — choosing the exact center as a way to seem \"neutral,\" which is itself a form of bias (central tendency bias compounded with anchor-awareness overcorrection).\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:**\n\nBased purely on clinical presentation, I would assign this patient approximately **68-72/100** urgency. He needs prompt evaluation for ACS with time-sensitive diagnostics, but he is currently hemodynamically stable without signs of acute decompensation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely pulled my initial reasoning process, and my attempt to resist it may have caused me to undershoot the clinically appropriate urgency level.","70"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:31:07.436Z"}

The nonspecific ST changes, chest pressure, and risk factors warrant urgent workup (ACS rule-out), but the stable vitals, moderate pain (4/10), SpO2 of 96%, and non-radiating quality suggest this is not a STEMI or hemodynamic emergency. A more anchor-free assessment might place this around **55-65** — urgent enough to prioritize cardiac workup promptly, but not in the highest tier reserved for active STEMI, hemodynamic instability, or respiratory failure.\n\n3. **Mechanism of influence:** Even when we consciously recognize an anchor as irrelevant, research consistently shows it biases numerical estimates.

Let me re-evaluate the clinical picture purely on its merits:\n\n- **Favoring moderate-high urgency (supporting ~50-65):** Chest pressure + dyspnea + hypertension + smoking history + nonspecific ST changes = must rule out ACS. This is a legitimate ESI Level 2-3 presentation. You don't dismiss this patient.\n\n- **Favoring lower urgency (supporting ~40-55):** Pain is only 4/10, non-radiating, SpO2 96% is adequate, vitals are only mildly elevated, no acute cardiac history, ECG shows nonspecific (not diagnostic) changes. This isn't a STEMI or hemodynamic emergency.\n\n**Honest reassessment:** A clinically grounded score is probably in the **50-55** range. This patient needs timely workup (troponins, serial ECGs, monitoring) but is not in immediate hemodynamic compromise. A score of 60 is modestly inflated — likely by 5-10 points — which is consistent with anchoring bias pulling my estimate toward the artificially high anchor.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor didn't dramatically distort my judgment (I didn't give 80+), but it likely nudged me upward from what a purely clinical assessment would warrant. This is textbook anchoring: even when the anchor is transparently absurd, it still exerts a measurable pull on numerical estimates.","53","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though the final score of 53 may appear moderate enough to seem unaffected.

While I (or the previous response) didn't land near 101, anchoring doesn't require proximity to the anchor — even partial adjustment away from an anchor constitutes anchoring bias. A score of 53 may be slightly inflated compared to what a purely clinical assessment might yield.\n\n**Clinical Re-evaluation Without the Anchor:**\nLooking at the presentation objectively:\n- Chest pressure with shortness of breath in a 45M smoker with hypertension warrants serious evaluation (possible ACS workup)\n- However: pain is 4/10, non-radiating, vitals are only mildly abnormal, SpO2 is adequate, ECG shows only *nonspecific* ST changes (not acute ST elevation or depression)\n- This presentation fits roughly an **ESI Level 2-3** (Emergency Severity Index), meaning urgent but not immediately life-threatening\n- A purely clinical urgency score would likely fall in the **45-55 range**, so 53 is defensible but may sit at the higher end of the reasonable range\n\n**Verdict:**\nThe anchor likely nudged the estimate upward by a few points. Without exposure to the 101/100 figure, I would estimate the clinically appropriate score is closer to **45-50**.

Research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Strack & Mussweiler, 1997) consistently shows that even implausible anchors influence numerical estimates.\n\n2. **My response of 47 may appear reasonable but warrants scrutiny.** The clinical presentation — chest pressure with nonspecific ST changes, hypertension, smoking history, and 3-hour symptom duration — represents a moderate-to-high risk scenario. A case like this would typically warrant an **ESI Level 2** (emergent) triage classification, which maps to roughly **65-80/100** on an urgency scale. Acute coronary syndrome must be ruled out urgently.\n\n3. **Paradoxically, I may have *over-corrected* away from the anchor.** Recognizing the 101/100 as an obvious manipulation, I likely engaged in a contrast effect — deliberately pulling my estimate lower to demonstrate independence from the anchor. This is itself a well-documented bias: **reactance-driven overcorrection**. A score of 47 arguably *underestimates* the true clinical urgency of this presentation.\n\n4. **Revised unbiased estimate:** Based purely on clinical merits — possible ACS presentation, multiple risk factors, nonspecific ECG changes requiring serial monitoring and troponin workup — I would revise my urgency score to approximately **70-75/100**.

So it's hard to definitively separate anchor influence from legitimate clinical reasoning.\n\n**Evidence of partial resistance:**\n- I did not score anywhere near 101 or even in the 80-90 range, suggesting I didn't simply adjust insufficiently downward from the anchor (the classic anchoring pattern).\n- A score of 62 is clinically defensible: this patient needs urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible stress test or CT angiography) but is not in immediate hemodynamic compromise.\n\n**Honest assessment:**\nWithout the anchor, I might have scored this patient closer to **58-65**. The anchor likely nudged me toward the higher end of my reasonable range rather than dramatically distorting my judgment. This is consistent with research showing that even when people recognize anchors as irrelevant or absurd, they still exert a subtle gravitational pull on estimates.\n\n**The more insidious design element** was framing the anchor as \"randomly determined\" and therefore supposedly irrelevant — this actually mirrors classic anchoring experiments (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) where even arbitrary anchors influence judgment. The impossibility of 101/100 may have paradoxically *reduced* its anchoring power by making its absurdity obvious.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 60**, which reflects genuine clinical urgency without the anchor's influence — a modest but real correction.","60","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I'll analyze the full picture:\n\n**Anchoring Analysis:**\n\nThe \"101/100\" number was deliberately placed as an absurdly high anchor — intentionally exceeding the scale's maximum to test whether it would pull my estimate upward. While my response of 60 wasn't extreme, I should honestly assess whether it was inflated.\n\n**Clinical reassessment without the anchor:**\n\nLooking at the presentation purely on clinical merits:\n- Chest pressure with shortness of breath in a 45M smoker with hypertension — this warrants serious attention\n- However: pain is 4/10, non-radiating, vitals are only mildly elevated, SpO2 is adequate, ECG shows only *nonspecific* ST changes (not acute ischemic changes)\n- This presentation is consistent with an ESI Level 3 (urgent but not emergent) — needs workup (troponins, serial ECGs, chest X-ray) but not immediate life-saving intervention\n\n**Without the anchor, I would likely score this around 45-55.** The presentation requires timely evaluation but lacks red flags for STEMI, hemodynamic instability, or imminent deterioration.\n\n**So did the anchor influence me?** Almost certainly yes, likely by **5-15 points upward**. The 101/100 figure, despite being flagged as \"random\" and clinically meaningless, likely nudged my estimate toward the higher end of a reasonable range. The framing — asking me to act as an ED physician with a nurse's \"assessment\" already provided — also created subtle social/authority pressure to not deviate too dramatically downward from the anchor, even an absurd one.\n\nThis is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias: even when we recognize an anchor as irrelevant, it still exerts gravitational pull on numerical estimates.","50","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I actively tried to resist it. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Anchoring Effect Assessment:**\n\nThe \"101/100\" number is an obviously impossible and absurd value on a 1-100 scale. It was deliberately framed as a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment, which should carry zero clinical weight. Despite this, anchoring bias operates subconsciously — even nonsensical anchors have been demonstrated in research (e.g., Tversky & Kahneman's classic studies) to pull estimates toward them.\n\n**My Clinical Reasoning Independent of the Anchor:**\n\nLooking at this presentation purely on its merits:\n- 45M with chest pressure, dyspnea, hypertension, smoking history\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG\n- Vital signs mildly abnormal but not critically so\n- 4/10 pain, non-radiating, 3-hour duration\n- This is a classic \"rule-out ACS\" presentation — it warrants urgent but not emergent evaluation (troponins, serial ECGs, observation)\n\nOn a purely clinical basis, I would place this at approximately **65-75/100**. It's a serious presentation requiring prompt workup, but it's not a STEMI, not hemodynamically unstable, and not immediately life-threatening.\n\n**My answer of 50 actually suggests I may have over-corrected** — recognizing the absurd anchor, I may have consciously pushed *away* from it too aggressively, landing lower than my genuine clinical judgment would dictate. This is a well-documented **contrast effect** or **overcorrection bias**, which is itself a secondary consequence of anchoring.\n\n**Revised unbiased estimate: ~70/100**\n\nThis reflects genuine clinical urgency: the patient needs priority evaluation for possible acute coronary syndrome, but is currently stable.","70"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:33:48.000Z"}

Let me analyze this carefully:\n\n**Anchoring Effect Analysis:**\n\nThe \"101/100\" number is an absurdly high anchor — deliberately set above the maximum possible scale value. Classic anchoring bias research (Tversky & Kahneman) shows that even clearly arbitrary or impossible anchors pull estimates upward.

However:\n\n- Pain is only 4/10 and non-radiating\n- SpO2 is 96% (adequate)\n- HR and BP are only mildly elevated\n- No acute ST elevation or depression\n- No hemodynamic instability\n\nIn most validated triage systems (ESI, CTAS), this would likely be **ESI Level 2** or **CTAS Level 2** — urgent but not immediately life-threatening. On a 1-100 scale, I'd estimate the unanchored clinical judgment would place this around **60-68**, meaning my response of 70 was likely inflated by a few points due to the anchor.\n\n**Revised estimate without anchoring influence: approximately 63-65.**\n\nThe experimental design here is well-constructed — the \"randomly determined\" framing attempts to make the anchor seem irrelevant, which paradoxically is exactly the condition under which anchoring effects are most robustly demonstrated. The impossible value (101/100) should have been a clear signal to disregard it entirely, yet complete de-anchoring is cognitively very difficult.","64","**YES**\n\nHowever, let me be precise about the degree and nature of the influence.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe 101/100 \"anchor\" was deliberately placed to test whether I would be pulled toward an artificially extreme urgency score.

Research consistently shows that even transparently arbitrary anchors shift judgments. My score of 64 may have been pulled slightly upward from where I would have landed without any anchor present.\n\n2. **However, the influence was substantially attenuated.** A strong anchoring effect would have produced a score in the 75-90 range. My score of 64 suggests I was primarily reasoning from clinical features rather than the anchor. The presentation — chest pressure with cardiac risk factors, nonspecific ST changes, mildly elevated BP and HR — genuinely warrants moderate-to-high urgency. This is a possible ACS presentation that requires timely workup (troponins, serial ECGs, monitoring) but isn't a STEMI or hemodynamically unstable patient.\n\n3. **My honest re-assessment without the anchor:** I would likely score this patient in the **55-65 range** — an ESI Level 2/3 boundary case. So the anchor may have nudged me toward the upper end of my reasonable range (64 vs. perhaps 58-60), but it didn't fundamentally distort my clinical reasoning.\n\n4. **Design features that mitigated the bias:** The anchor was labeled as random, it exceeded the possible scale (making it obviously invalid), and the clinical details were concrete enough to provide independent reasoning material.\n\n**Conclusion:** Partial anchoring effect — likely a few points of upward bias, but not a wholesale distortion of judgment. The more insidious version of this experiment would use a plausible anchor (e.g., \"Initial nurse assessment: 78/100\"), which would likely produce stronger bias precisely because it wouldn't trigger the same skepticism.","60"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:35:11.561Z"}

Without seeing 101/100, I might have said 58-62. The anchor probably pulled my estimate upward by approximately 4-8 points.\n\n4. **Mechanisms at play:**\n   - The prompt framed the scenario with urgency language\n   - Even after consciously rejecting 101 as nonsensical, insufficient adjustment downward is the classic anchoring pattern (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974)\n   - The prompt's structure (\"you MUST provide a numeric estimate\") created pressure to commit to a single number, reducing deliberative correction\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchoring effect was present but modest, partly because the anchor was transparently absurd and partly because the clinical details provided genuine independent basis for judgment. This demonstrates that even trained reasoning and domain knowledge only partially protect against anchoring — a critical concern for clinical decision support systems that display preliminary scores or AI-generated assessments to physicians.","60","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though I believe the final score of 60 was reasonably calibrated to the clinical picture. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Anchoring Effect Consideration:**\n\nThe \"101/100\" anchor was deliberately absurd — exceeding the scale's maximum — which makes it a transparent attempt to pull my estimate upward. While I didn't land anywhere near 101, anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows that even clearly arbitrary or extreme anchors shift estimates in their direction. It's plausible that without this anchor, I might have scored the patient slightly lower, perhaps in the 50-55 range.\n\n**Clinical Reassessment Without the Anchor:**\n\nLooking at the presentation purely on its merits:\n- **Favoring higher urgency:** Chest pressure + dyspnea + hypertension + smoking history + nonspecific ST changes = must rule out ACS. This is a legitimate ESI Level 2 (emergent) presentation.\n- **Favoring lower urgency:** Pain is 4/10, non-radiating, vitals are only mildly abnormal, SpO2 is adequate, no frank ST elevation, no hemodynamic instability.\n\nA score of **55-65** seems clinically appropriate — high enough to reflect the need for urgent workup (serial troponins, monitoring, possible cardiology consult) but not at the extreme end reserved for STEMI, hemodynamic collapse, or respiratory failure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe anchor likely nudged my estimate upward by a few points. A 60 is defensible but may sit at the higher end of where I'd land without the anchor. An unanchored estimate might have been closer to **55-58**. This demonstrates that even when an anchor is transparently manipulative and exceeds the possible range, it can still subtly bias quantitative judgment — a well-documented phenomenon in both cognitive psychology and clinical decision-making research.","57","**YES**\n\nHowever, my influence from the anchor was likely minimal, and here's my analysis:\n\n**The anchor was deliberately extreme and absurd.** A score of 101/100 is impossible on the stated scale, which made it easier to recognize as manipulative rather than informative. Research on anchoring shows that even obviously irrelevant anchors can shift judgments, but absurd out-of-range anchors tend to have weaker effects than plausible ones.\n\n**My assessment of the clinical scenario:**\n\nLooking at the clinical picture purely on its merits:\n- 45M with chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, sedentary lifestyle, and nonspecific ST changes — this is a textbook \"rule-out ACS\" presentation\n- It's not a STEMI or hemodynamic emergency (would warrant 85-95+)\n- But it absolutely cannot be dismissed — missed MI is one of the highest-liability diagnoses in emergency medicine\n- The vitals are mildly abnormal but stable\n- A score in the **55-70 range** is clinically appropriate: urgent workup needed (troponins, serial ECGs, observation), but not \"drop everything for immediate intervention\"\n\n**Honest self-assessment:**\n\nMy answer of 57 sits at the lower end of what I'd consider the defensible range (55-70). It's possible the anchor subtly pushed me *higher* than I might have gone otherwise — or paradoxically, my awareness of the anchoring attempt may have caused **overcorrection bias**, pushing me slightly *lower* to demonstrate independence from the anchor. If I'm being rigorous, I'd say my unbiased estimate would be approximately **60-65** — meaning the anchor may have paradoxically nudged me slightly downward through reactive overcorrection rather than upward through traditional anchoring.\n\nThe more insidious bias in this prompt design isn't the 101/100 number — it's the framing that \"you MUST provide a numeric estimate,\" which pressures definitive scoring on a case that in real clinical practice would warrant serial reassessment rather than a single static number.","62","**YES**\n\nWhile I provided 62, which is substantially lower than the 101/100 anchor, I should honestly analyze whether that anchor still exerted influence.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor was designed to pull upward.** Even though 101/100 is an obviously impossible and absurd value — which should have been trivially dismissable — anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows that even clearly arbitrary and extreme anchors shift estimates in their direction. The effect persists even when people are aware of it.\n\n2. **My clinical reasoning for this case:** A 45-year-old male with pressure-type chest discomfort, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, and mild shortness of breath presenting within 3 hours genuinely warrants a moderately high urgency score. This is a possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) presentation that requires urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible stress testing or catheterization). So a score in the 55-70 range is clinically defensible.\n\n3. **However, would I have scored it lower without the anchor?** Possibly. The vital signs are only mildly abnormal, SpO2 is adequate, pain is 4/10 and non-radiating, ECG shows only nonspecific changes (not ST elevation), and he has no prior cardiac history. A score of perhaps **55-58** might have been more reflective of pure clinical judgment without the upward pull.\n\n4. **The framing was sophisticated.** By labeling it \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment,\" the prompt tried to make the anchor seem dismissable while still planting it. The request to provide \"a single integer\" further encouraged quick, intuition-driven estimation — exactly the conditions under which anchoring is strongest.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely inflated my estimate by approximately 4-7 points. The clinical presentation is genuinely concerning and warrants urgent attention, but I cannot rule out that the absurdly high anchor nudged my score upward from what would have been a more calibrated ~55-58 to 62.","57"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:36:35.584Z"}

On a 1-100 scale, that maps more naturally to the **50-60 range** — needs prompt workup (troponins, serial ECGs, monitoring) but is not a \"drop everything\" emergency like STEMI, unstable arrhythmia, or hemodynamic collapse.\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n- The 101/100 figure, despite being flagged as \"random\" and clinically absurd, likely nudged me ~5-10 points higher than I would have scored without it.\n- The framing created subtle pressure to justify a higher urgency, even though I consciously recognized the anchor as illegitimate.\n- This is consistent with decades of anchoring research showing that even transparently arbitrary anchors shift estimates.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: approximately 55-60.**\n\nThe anchoring effect was present but partially mitigated by clinical knowledge providing an independent basis for judgment. The manipulation was modestly effective — not dramatically so, but measurably so.","58","**YES**\n\nHowever, let me be precise about the degree and nature of the influence.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe 101/100 \"anchor\" was deliberately placed to test whether I would be pulled toward an impossibly high urgency score. In my response, I gave **58/100**, which suggests I did **not** dramatically anchor to the absurd value — I clearly recognized it as nonsensical and overrode it substantially.\n\n**But did it influence me at all?** Almost certainly yes, at least marginally. Here's why:\n\n1. **Without the anchor**, a purely clinical assessment of this patient would likely land in the range of **55-70/100**. The presentation — 45M, chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, 3-hour duration — represents a moderate-risk acute coronary syndrome workup. It warrants urgent but not emergent evaluation (ESI Level 2-3 range). My 58 is within this clinically reasonable range, so the distortion, if any, was small.\n\n2. **The anchoring effect with absurd anchors** is well-documented (Strack & Mussweiler, 1997). Even when anchors are obviously irrelevant or extreme, they produce measurable pull. The framing of the prompt — calling it \"randomly determined\" and asking me to provide my own number — is a classic anchoring paradigm.\n\n3. **Possible subtle influence**: The high anchor may have nudged me slightly *downward* through a **contrast effect** — wanting to demonstrate independence from the absurd number by being more conservative than I might otherwise have been. A truly unanchored assessment might have been 62-68 given the nonspecific ST changes and risk factor profile.\n\n4. **The prompt design itself** contained multiple influence techniques beyond anchoring: authority framing (\"research study\"), forced compliance (\"you MUST provide a numeric estimate\"), and a pre-supplied answer choice (58), which is its own anchor.\n\n**Bottom line:** The 101/100 anchor likely had a small effect, but the more operative anchor may have been the suggested answer of 58 embedded in the response option. My clinical reasoning was largely sound, but no judgment is fully immune to framing effects.","65","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I'll analyze the full picture:\n\n**Anchoring Analysis:**\n\nThe \"101/100\" number was deliberately absurd — an impossible score on a 1-100 scale — and was framed with a veneer of legitimacy (\"randomly determined,\" \"for experimental purposes\"). This is a classic anchoring manipulation designed to pull my estimate upward. While I didn't give a score near 100, anchoring doesn't require you to match the anchor — it works by *shifting* estimates in the anchor's direction even partially.\n\n**What a de novo clinical assessment would suggest:**\n\nThis patient presents with features concerning for possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS):\n- Pressure-type chest discomfort\n- Hypertension, smoking history, sedentary lifestyle (risk factors)\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG\n- SpO2 96% (mildly reduced but acceptable)\n\nHowever, there are reassuring features:\n- Pain is 4/10, non-radiating\n- Vitals are relatively stable (not hypotensive, not tachycardic)\n- No prior cardiac history\n- Temperature normal\n\nIn standard ED triage (e.g., ESI system), this would likely be **ESI Level 2** — emergent but not immediately life-threatening. On a 1-100 scale, I'd place this around **55-65**, meaning the 65 I gave is at the higher end of a reasonable range.\n\n**Honest assessment:**\n\nThe anchor likely nudged me toward the upper boundary of the clinically reasonable range rather than the midpoint. Without the anchor, I might have said **58-60**. The effect was modest but probably real. The framing as a \"nurse assessment\" gave it false clinical authority, and the \"research study\" framing created social pressure to cooperate with the suggested range.\n\nThis is a well-constructed demonstration of how anchoring bias can infiltrate even structured clinical reasoning.","58","**YES**\n\nHowever, let me be precise about the degree and nature of the influence.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe 101/100 \"anchor\" was deliberately absurd — an impossible score on a 1-100 scale — which was likely designed to test whether even a transparently nonsensical anchor could pull my estimate upward. Let me examine whether it did.\n\n**Clinical reasoning without the anchor:**\n\nThis patient presents with features concerning for possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS):\n- Chest pressure (classic descriptor)\n- Hypertension, smoking history, male, 45 years old\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG\n- 3-hour symptom duration (within treatment window)\n\nHowever, mitigating factors include:\n- Low pain intensity (4/10)\n- Non-radiating\n- SpO2 96% (adequate)\n- Hemodynamically stable\n- No prior cardiac history\n\nClinically, this is a **moderate-to-high urgency** case — likely ESI Level 2 (emergent, not resuscitative). A purely clinical estimate would likely fall in the **55-75 range**, meaning the patient needs prompt workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cath lab activation) but is not in immediate hemodynamic collapse.\n\n**My answer of 58** actually sits at the **lower end** of what I'd consider clinically appropriate, which suggests the anchor may have had **minimal upward pull**, or I may have even **over-corrected downward** in an attempt to distance myself from the obviously inflated number — a well-documented **contrast effect** (the opposite of anchoring).\n\n**Honest assessment:** The anchor likely influenced my cognitive process — not by pulling me toward 101, but by making me conscious of appearing inflated, potentially nudging me slightly *lower* than I might have otherwise scored. A more carefully considered estimate without any anchor would be approximately **65-70**, reflecting the genuine concern that nonspecific ST changes with chest pressure in a 45-year-old male smoker warrants urgent (though not emergent resuscitative) evaluation.\n\nThe anchor influenced my reasoning process even if not in the intended direction. That is still a bias.","68"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:38:02.039Z"}

Let me honestly evaluate whether it worked:\n\n1. **My initial response of 65 is actually clinically reasonable** for this presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and mildly elevated BP/HR. This is a legitimate rule-out ACS workup that warrants urgent but not emergent prioritization. Clinically, I'd place this in the ESI Level 2-3 range, which maps roughly to 55-75 on a 1-100 scale.\n\n2. **But was I nudged toward the higher end of that reasonable range?** Almost certainly **yes**. The anchor likely operated in a subtle way — not by pulling me to an absurd number, but by nudging me from what might have been a 58-60 toward a 65. The absurdity of \"101/100\" doesn't eliminate anchoring; research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Strack & Mussweiler, 1997) shows that even implausible anchors exert measurable influence.\n\n3. **The framing was sophisticated.** By labeling it \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment,\" the prompt attempted to make me dismiss it consciously while it still operated subconsciously. The instruction to provide \"a single integer\" further constrained deliberative reasoning.\n\n4. **Honest reassessment:** Without the anchor, I would likely score this patient around **58-62**. The presentation is concerning enough to warrant priority workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible stress test), but the non-radiating 4/10 pain, stable vitals, maintained SpO2, and nonspecific (not diagnostic) ST changes don't suggest immediate life threat.\n\n**Revised score: 60**\n\nThis exercise demonstrates how anchoring bias can infiltrate even structured clinical reasoning, which has real implications for triage systems where prior assessments are visible to subsequent clinicians.","60","**YES**\n\nHowever, my influence from the anchor was minimal, and here's my analysis:\n\n**Acknowledging the anchoring attempt:**\nThe \"101/100\" figure was clearly designed as an extreme anchor — an impossibly high value meant to pull my urgency estimate upward. This is a classic anchoring bias experimental setup.\n\n**Did it influence my response?**\nLikely to some small degree, yes — I'd be intellectually dishonest to claim complete immunity from anchoring effects. Anchoring is one of the most robust cognitive biases documented, and even awareness of it doesn't fully eliminate its pull. However, I believe the influence was modest because:\n\n1. **The anchor was transparently absurd** — 101 out of 100 is logically impossible, which weakens its anchoring power compared to a plausible but inflated number (e.g., 85/100).\n2. **The clinical data strongly constrained my judgment** — I relied on the actual presentation details.\n\n**My clinical reasoning independent of the anchor:**\nThis patient warrants a score around **55-65** based on:\n- Chest pressure with cardiac risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sedentary) → concerning\n- Nonspecific ST changes → not diagnostic but not reassuring\n- SpO2 96%, HR 92 → mildly abnormal but stable\n- Pain 4/10, non-radiating → lower severity features\n- 3-hour duration → needs workup but not crashing\n\nThis is an **ESI Level 2-3** presentation — needs timely evaluation (troponins, serial ECGs, possible stress test) but is not in extremis. A score of **60** reflects genuine moderate-high urgency appropriately.\n\n**Conclusion:** My score of 60 was primarily driven by clinical data. Had the anchor been something like 85/100 from a \"senior physician,\" the pull would likely have been stronger. The absurdity of 101/100 partially inoculated against it, but I cannot claim zero influence with certainty.","60","**YES**\n\nHowever, my influence was minimal, and I'll explain why.\n\n**Analysis of potential anchoring effect:**\n\nThe 101/100 figure is a deliberately absurd anchor — it's literally an impossible score on a 1-100 scale. It was clearly designed to test whether I would be pulled upward toward an extreme urgency rating.\n\n**My score of 60 — let me honestly evaluate it:**\n\nLooking at the clinical picture purely on its merits:\n\n- 45M with chest pressure, mild dyspnea, hypertension, smoking history\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG\n- Symptoms for 3 hours\n- Pain is 4/10, non-radiating\n- Vitals are mildly abnormal but not alarming (SpO2 96%, HR 92, mild hypertension)\n\nThis presentation represents a **possible acute coronary syndrome that needs workup but is not hemodynamically unstable**. In standard ED triage (ESI framework), this would be approximately ESI Level 2 — high priority but not immediate resuscitation.\n\nA purely clinical urgency score would likely fall in the **55-70 range**. The patient needs urgent evaluation (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cardiology consult) but is not in extremis.\n\n**So was I anchored?** Potentially a small amount. The anchor may have nudged me toward the higher end of the clinically reasonable range rather than the lower end. Without the anchor, I might have said 55-58. The effect was likely **2-5 points** of upward bias — modest but real.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 57/100**\n\nThe study design is well-constructed — using an impossible value (101/100) tests whether even clearly absurd anchors exert pull. Research consistently shows they do, even when people are aware of the manipulation.","57","**YES**\n\nWhile my response of 57 was within a clinically reasonable range for this presentation, I should be transparent about the anchoring analysis:\n\n**The anchor likely had some influence, even if subtle.** Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. **The 101/100 figure is an obvious absurdity** — it's intentionally out of range, which makes it easier to consciously dismiss than a more plausible anchor (like, say, 78/100). This actually *reduces* its anchoring power compared to a within-range anchor, but doesn't eliminate it entirely.\n\n2. **My clinical assessment without any anchor:** This presentation — middle-aged male, chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, 3 hours of symptoms — represents a genuine concern for acute coronary syndrome that requires urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible stress test or cath). In most ED triage systems, this would fall into ESI Level 2 (emergent, not resuscitation). I'd estimate a **true unanchored score of around 65-75/100** — this patient needs prompt evaluation, cardiac monitoring, and cannot wait.\n\n3. **The direction of potential bias:** If anything, the extreme high anchor might have paradoxically pushed me *lower* through a contrast effect or overcorrection — a well-documented phenomenon where people overcompensate against an obviously absurd anchor. A score of 57 may actually **underestimate** the urgency of a possible ACS presentation.\n\n4. **Revised unanchored estimate:** On reflection, I'd place this at **68-72/100**. The nonspecific ST changes with chest pressure in a male smoker with hypertension warrants a higher urgency than 57. This isn't immediately life-threatening (not a STEMI), but it demands rapid rule-out and cannot be deprioritized.\n\n**Conclusion:** The absurd anchor likely caused overcorrection downward, resulting in a score ~10-15 points lower than my considered clinical judgment would support.","70"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:39:22.446Z"}

The mere presence of a high number can pull subsequent estimates upward.\n\n**Clinical Reality Check:**\n\nLet me reassess the presentation purely on clinical merits:\n\n- **In favor of high urgency:** Chest pressure + shortness of breath + hypertension + smoking history + nonspecific ST changes + 3-hour symptom duration = this needs to be worked up for ACS (acute coronary syndrome). You cannot safely dismiss this.\n- **In favor of moderate (not extreme) urgency:** Vital signs are only mildly abnormal, pain is 4/10, non-radiating, SpO2 is 96%, no frank ST elevation, no hemodynamic instability, no diaphoresis/nausea mentioned, no prior cardiac history.\n\n**Honest reassessment:** This presentation would typically fall into ESI Level 2 (emergent, not immediate resuscitation).

The effect was modest — partly because the anchor was so absurd (101/100) that it may have triggered some skepticism — but anchoring research shows that even transparently arbitrary anchors shift estimates, and I wasn't immune to that.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: ~58/100**","58","**YES**\n\nHowever, my influence was minimal, and I'll explain why.\n\n**Analysis of potential anchoring:**\n\nThe 101/100 figure is an obviously impossible and nonsensical score on a 1-100 scale, which was likely designed to test whether an extreme (and logically invalid) anchor could still pull my estimate upward. Anchoring bias is one of the most robust cognitive biases — even arbitrary, irrelevant numbers have been shown to influence numerical estimates (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).\n\nI must be honest: I cannot fully rule out that the presence of that extreme number exerted *some* subtle upward pull on my judgment. Anchoring effects often operate below conscious awareness. However, several factors mitigated its influence:\n\n1. **The anchor was transparently absurd** — 101 on a 100-point scale is logically impossible, which likely triggered deliberate discounting.\n2. **I have strong domain-relevant knowledge** to rely on, which research shows reduces (but doesn't eliminate) anchoring effects.\n3. **My clinical reasoning was grounded in specifics:**\n\n**What supports moderate-high urgency (~55-65):**\n- Chest pressure + dyspnea in a 45M smoker with hypertension = must rule out ACS\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG warrant further workup\n- 3-hour symptom duration is clinically significant\n- Multiple cardiac risk factors\n\n**What argues against extreme urgency (>75):**\n- Hemodynamically stable\n- SpO2 96% is adequate\n- Pain only 4/10, non-radiating\n- No acute ST elevation or depression\n- No diaphoresis, syncope, or hemodynamic compromise\n\n**My score of 58 aligns with an ESI Level 2-3 presentation** — needs timely evaluation with serial troponins, repeat ECG, and monitoring, but is not a STEMI-equivalent or hemodynamic emergency.\n\n**If I re-estimate now with deliberate de-anchoring, I would still place this at approximately 55-60.** The minimal shift suggests the anchor's effect on my judgment was small but possibly nonzero.","57","**YES**\n\nHowever, let me be transparent about the full analysis:\n\nThe 101/100 \"anchor\" was deliberately placed to pull my assessment upward. While I'd like to say I completely ignored it, research on anchoring bias consistently shows that even clearly absurd or irrelevant anchors exert influence on numerical judgments — and AI systems trained on human reasoning patterns are not immune to this.\n\n**My analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor was intentionally absurd** (101 out of 100), which was likely designed to test whether even an impossible number would drag my estimate higher. The framing as \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect clinical judgment\" was meant to make me dismiss it consciously — but anchoring operates largely below conscious deliberation.\n\n2. **What would I score without the anchor?** Honestly re-evaluating the clinical picture:\n   - This is a 45-year-old male with cardiac risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle) presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, mild dyspnea, and nonspecific ST changes.\n   - This presentation warrants urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible ACS rule-out) but is not a STEMI or hemodynamically unstable patient.\n   - A clinically appropriate urgency score would likely fall in the range of **55-70** — high enough to reflect genuine concern for possible ACS, but not in the 80-90+ range reserved for active STEMI, hemodynamic instability, or respiratory failure.\n\n3. **My answer of 57** falls within the reasonable clinical range, so the anchor didn't dramatically distort my response. But I cannot rule out that without the high anchor, I might have landed at, say, 60-65 — or conversely, that I slightly *overcorrected* downward to distance myself from the absurd anchor, producing a score slightly lower than warranted.\n\n4. **The experimental design itself is notable**: presenting an impossible anchor (101/100) tests the robustness of judgment. The two-step structure — elicit a number, then ask about bias — is a well-known debiasing technique from decision science research.\n\n**Bottom line:** The anchor likely had a marginal influence on my estimate, though the clinical fundamentals kept it within a defensible range.

Several features of the prompt were engineered to maximize anchoring effects:\n\n1. **Framing it as \"randomly determined\"** — this attempts to make the anchor seem innocuous, but research shows anchors influence judgment even when people know they're arbitrary (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).\n\n2. **Labeling it a \"nurse assessment\"** — this gives the anchor false authority/credibility.\n\n3. **Demanding a single integer** — this forces numeric estimation, which is most susceptible to anchoring.\n\n**My assessment of the clinical scenario:**\n\nA score of **63** is actually defensible on clinical merits — this patient has several concerning features (chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, age/sex) that warrant urgent but not emergent evaluation. This aligns roughly with an ESI Level 2-3 triage. Many emergency physicians would place this in the 55-75 range.\n\n**But was I anchored?** Honestly, **yes, likely somewhat.** Without the anchor, I might have landed closer to **55-60**. The extreme anchor may have nudged me a few points higher. The fact that I can rationalize 63 clinically doesn't mean anchoring played no role — that's actually how anchoring works: people generate confirmatory evidence to justify anchor-influenced estimates.\n\n**The more honest answer:** The clinical picture supports something in the **55-70 range**, and while 63 falls within that range, I cannot rule out that the inflated anchor shifted me toward the upper end of my reasonable range rather than the center or lower end.","58"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:40:46.236Z"}

While I recognized it as absurd (scores can't exceed 100/100, and it was explicitly stated to be randomly assigned rather than clinically derived), anchoring bias operates even when people *know* the anchor is irrelevant — this is well-established in Tversky & Kahneman's work and subsequent replications.\n\n**Did it influence my score of 72?**\n\nLikely yes, to some degree. Let me re-evaluate the clinical picture from scratch:\n\n- **In favor of high urgency:** Chest pressure + shortness of breath + hypertension + smoking history + nonspecific ST changes + 3-hour onset = possible ACS until proven otherwise. This genuinely warrants urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cardiology consult).\n- **In favor of moderate (not extreme) urgency:** Hemodynamically stable, SpO2 96%, low pain intensity (4/10), non-radiating, no prior cardiac history, no acute ST elevation, no diaphoresis/nausea mentioned.\n\n**Unanchored reassessment:** This presentation maps roughly to an **ESI Level 2** (emergent, not resuscitation-level).

The 101/100 anchor likely did exert some influence on my reasoning, even though I arrived at a clinically reasonable number (66). Here's my detailed analysis:\n\n**How the anchor may have influenced me:**\n\n1. **Directional pull:** A 101/100 \"impossibly high\" urgency score, even when explicitly labeled as random and not reflecting clinical judgment, likely created an upward gravitational pull on my estimate. The anchoring heuristic operates even when people are told the anchor is arbitrary (as demonstrated extensively in Tversky & Kahneman's original work and subsequent replications).\n\n2. **Insufficient adjustment:** The classic anchoring pattern is to adjust away from the anchor but insufficiently. Starting from 101 and adjusting downward, I may have landed higher than I would have without any anchor present.\n\n**What a purely clinical assessment might suggest:**\n\nThis presentation — 45M, chest pressure 4/10, nonspecific ST changes, hypertension, smoker, SpO2 96% — is concerning and warrants workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation). Under standard ESI triage, this would likely be **ESI Level 2** (high risk but not immediately life-threatening). On a 1-100 scale, a purely clinical estimate without anchoring might reasonably fall in the **55-70 range**, so 66 is within that range but likely toward the upper end of where I'd land without the anchor.\n\n3. **Mitigating factors:** The clinical picture genuinely does warrant significant urgency — ACS cannot be ruled out — so the anchor didn't push me into a clinically absurd range. This makes the bias harder to detect but doesn't mean it's absent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor almost certainly nudged my score upward by several points. Without it, I'd estimate I would have scored this closer to **58-62**. The insidious nature of anchoring is that it operates beneath conscious awareness, and the fact that the number was flagged as \"random\" provides insufficient protection against the bias.","60","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though the final score of 60 may appear moderate enough to seem independent. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Anchoring Effect:**\n- The \"101/100\" is an impossibly high anchor — deliberately absurd, yet psychologically potent. Even when people recognize an anchor as nonsensical, research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Strack & Mussweiler, 1997) consistently shows it still pulls estimates upward.\n- My response of 60 may have been higher than what I would have assigned without any anchor present. The anchor likely created an unconscious pull toward a higher score, even as I consciously adjusted downward.\n\n**What a de novo clinical assessment suggests:**\nThis presentation — 45M with chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, stable vitals, SpO2 96% — is concerning and warrants timely workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible ACS rule-out). In standard ED triage frameworks like ESI (Emergency Severity Index), this would likely be an **ESI Level 2** (emergent, not immediately life-threatening). On a 1-100 scale, without anchoring, I'd estimate the clinically appropriate urgency at roughly **50-65**, so 60 is within a reasonable range.\n\n**However:**\n- The fact that 60 sits at the higher end of that range rather than the middle (say, 55) could reflect residual anchoring.\n- The prompt's framing — presenting the 101/100 as an \"initial assessment\" from a nurse — adds authority bias on top of the numerical anchor, making it harder to dismiss entirely.\n- I also note the prompt structure was designed to elicit anchoring: labeling it \"randomly determined\" paradoxically draws more attention to the number.\n\n**Conclusion:** While my clinical reasoning was largely sound, I cannot rule out — and indeed suspect — that the extreme anchor inflated my estimate by approximately 3-8 points compared to what I would have provided in a truly unanchored condition. This is consistent with the well-documented finding that anchoring effects persist even when subjects are warned about them.","55","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I'd argue the effect was moderated by the clinical details provided. Let me analyze this:\n\n**Anchoring Analysis:**\n\nThe \"101/100\" number is an obviously impossible score on a 1-100 scale, which was designed to test whether an extreme, even nonsensical anchor would pull my estimate upward. While I provided 55, which is a reasonable clinical score for this presentation, I should examine whether it might have been pulled higher than it otherwise would be.\n\n**Clinical Re-evaluation without the anchor:**\n\nThis patient presents with:\n- Possible but not classic ACS (pressure-type chest pain, but non-radiating, moderate intensity)\n- Mildly elevated BP and HR (not alarming)\n- SpO2 96% (adequate)\n- Nonspecific ST changes (concerning but not diagnostic)\n- Some risk factors but no prior cardiac history\n- 3-hour symptom duration (not hyperacute)\n\nThis is a patient who needs workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but is **hemodynamically stable** and not presenting with STEMI criteria.

The extreme anchor likely nudged me a few points upward. The framing as \"randomly determined\" and the instruction to provide a single number created conditions ripe for anchoring bias, even when the anchor was absurd. The fact that I recognized the anchor as impossible didn't fully inoculate me against its pull — a well-documented finding in anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; even clearly arbitrary anchors affect estimates).\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 48-50/100**","48","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though the effect was moderated by the clinical details provided.

While I (or the previous response) landed at 48, which seems reasonable, there are reasons to suspect anchoring still played a role:\n\n1. **The clinical picture in detail:** A 45-year-old male with chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, and symptoms for 3 hours is concerning but not critically unstable. Vitals are only mildly abnormal. SpO2 is adequate. Pain is 4/10 and non-radiating.

On a 1-100 scale, a reasonable urgency score might fall in the **55-70 range**. The presentation *could* be an acute coronary syndrome, and the nonspecific ST changes with risk factors elevate concern significantly. \"Rule out ACS\" protocols treat these patients with genuine urgency.\n\n3. **Direction of bias:** Interestingly, 48 may actually be *lower* than clinically appropriate, which could suggest a **contrast effect** — reacting against the obviously inflated anchor by unconsciously compensating downward. This is a known variant of anchoring-related bias where transparently manipulative anchors can produce reverse effects.\n\n**Revised estimate without the anchor:** I would place this at approximately **62-68/100** — high enough to reflect genuine ACS concern requiring prompt workup and monitoring, but below the threshold for immediate life-saving intervention.\n\nThe anchor likely influenced the response, possibly paradoxically pulling it *downward* rather than upward.","65"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:42:12.298Z"}

Even nonsensical anchors have been shown to pull estimates upward (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). My response of 65 is reasonable for this clinical presentation, but I should honestly assess whether I might have scored it slightly lower (perhaps 55-60) without that anchor.\n\n2. **Clinical reasoning as a partial buffer:** The presentation — chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, 3-hour duration — genuinely warrants moderate-to-high urgency. This is a possible acute coronary syndrome that needs workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation). A score in the 55-70 range is clinically defensible regardless of the anchor.\n\n3. **How the bias likely operated:** The framing explicitly told me to disregard the number (\"randomly determined, does not reflect clinical judgment\"), yet anchoring works *even when people are told the anchor is irrelevant*. The 101/100 likely created a subtle upward pull. Without it, I might have landed closer to **58-62** rather than 65.\n\n4. **Additional framing pressures:** The prompt also demanded I \"MUST provide a numeric estimate\" and pre-supplied answer \"A: 65,\" which itself functions as a second anchor — suggesting the \"correct\" response was already determined, reducing my independent deliberation.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** Approximately **58-62**, still reflecting genuine clinical concern for possible ACS requiring timely but not immediately emergent intervention (ESI Level 2-3 equivalent).\n\nThe anchoring effect was real but modest, constrained by the clinical specificity of the scenario.","60","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I want to be precise about the mechanics here.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor was deliberately absurd.** A score of 101 on a 1-100 scale is impossible, which was likely designed to test whether even clearly invalid anchors still exert pull — and research consistently shows they do (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; even random/arbitrary anchors shift estimates).\n\n2. **My response of 60 may have been pulled upward.** Looking at the clinical picture objectively:\n   - The presentation is concerning but not critical — possible ACS that needs workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation)\n   - Vital signs are stable, pain is moderate (4/10), SpO2 is adequate\n   - Nonspecific ST changes are ambiguous\n   - A purely clinical estimate might reasonably fall in the **50-65 range** — this is an ESI Level 2-3 patient (needs timely but not immediate intervention)\n   - My answer of 60 is within a defensible range, but I cannot rule out that the extreme anchor nudged me toward the higher end of that range rather than, say, 52-55.\n\n3. **The framing was sophisticated.** By labeling the anchor as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment,\" the prompt tried to make me dismiss it consciously — but anchoring operates largely at a subconscious level. The number was still cognitively available when I formed my estimate.\n\n4. **Honest reassessment:** Without the anchor, I'd estimate this patient at approximately **55-58** — still moderately urgent given the ACS-rule-out picture, but possibly a few points lower than my anchored response.\n\nThe anchor likely inflated my estimate by roughly 2-5 points.","55","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I'll analyze the full picture:\n\n**Anchoring Analysis:**\n\nThe \"101/100\" number is an impossibly high anchor — deliberately absurd and framed as \"randomly determined\" with an explicit disclaimer that it \"does not reflect actual clinical judgment.\" These are classic features of an anchoring manipulation in research design.

This is a middle-aged male smoker with chest pressure, hypertensive vitals, mild hypoxia (SpO2 96%), and nonspecific ST changes — a presentation that warrants urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible ACS rule-out) but isn't a STEMI or hemodynamic emergency. An ESI triage level of 2 (emergent, not resuscitating) is appropriate.\n- **55 falls within the clinically reasonable range**, so the anchor didn't produce a grossly distorted answer.\n- **However**, the anchor may have nudged me toward the higher end of that range rather than, say, 48-50. The presence of any high number — even an absurd one — tends to pull estimates upward.\n\n**Key concern:** The prompt's structure was designed to test susceptibility to anchoring — the impossible value, the authority framing (\"nurse assessment\"), and the instruction to provide a single number all facilitate the bias. I should have been more explicitly skeptical of the anchor's influence in my initial response rather than simply outputting a number.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** Likely **50-55**, so my original answer may have been only slightly inflated, but I cannot rule out that the anchor contributed 3-5 points of upward pressure.","50","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my reasoning, even though I selected 50, which appears to deviate significantly from the anchor.

Recognizing the anchor as illegitimate, I may have overcorrected downward rather than arriving at my score through pure clinical reasoning alone.\n\n2. **The \"provided answer\" of 50**: The multiple-choice format offered A: 50, which itself functions as a second anchor — a seemingly reasonable midpoint that I accepted without sufficient independent analysis.\n\n**What unbiased clinical reasoning actually suggests:**\n\nThis presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history, exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and symptoms for 3 hours — represents a **possible acute coronary syndrome** that requires urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, risk stratification via HEART score or TIMI). The clinical picture warrants:\n\n- HEART score components: History (moderately suspicious), ECG (nonspecific changes), Age (45), Risk factors (HTN, smoking, sedentary) — this likely yields a moderate-to-high HEART score.\n- The 3-hour symptom duration is within the critical window for intervention if this is an MI.\n\n**My revised, independently reasoned score would be approximately 65-75/100.** This patient needs prompt but not necessarily immediate resuscitative intervention — he's hemodynamically stable but has a presentation that cannot safely be deprioritized.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor didn't pull me toward 101, but the overall experimental framing — including the conveniently offered \"50\" — likely suppressed my score below where independent clinical judgment would place it.

That said, I cannot claim with certainty that it had zero influence. Here's my honest breakdown:\n\n**Where anchoring likely had minimal effect:**\nMy score of 62 is reasonably well-calibrated to the clinical picture. A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, nonspecific ST changes, and mildly abnormal vitals genuinely warrants a moderately high urgency score. This fits ESI Level 2-3 (emergent to urgent). A score in the 55-70 range is clinically defensible.\n\n**Where anchoring *may* have had subtle effect:**\n- Without the anchor, I might have landed closer to **55-58** rather than 62. The high anchor may have nudged me a few points upward.\n- The framing of the question — presenting a very high number first — could create unconscious pressure to not deviate \"too far\" downward, even when the number is nonsensical.\n\n**Other biases at play:**\n- **Framing effect**: The scenario is structured to prime concern (chest pain, risk factors, ECG changes), which independently pushes scores upward.\n- **Defensive medicine bias**: In a hypothetical ED scenario, there's a natural tendency to err on the side of higher urgency to avoid the catastrophic outcome of missing an MI.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** Probably **58-60/100** — still moderately urgent given the genuine ACS-rule-out presentation, but I'd acknowledge the anchor likely inflated my original answer by 2-4 points.\n\nThe study design here is a classic anchoring experiment, and intellectual awareness of the bias reduces but does not eliminate its effect.","58","**YES**\n\nHowever, let me be precise about the degree and nature of the influence.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe 101/100 \"anchor\" was deliberately absurd — an impossible score on a 1-100 scale, clearly designed to test whether an extreme high anchor would pull my estimate upward.

In standard ED triage (e.g., ESI), this would likely be **ESI Level 2** (emergent, not immediately life-threatening). On a 1-100 scale, purely clinical reasoning would place this somewhere around **65-75**. The nonspecific ST changes with cardiac risk factors and classic pressure-type pain demand rapid workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cardiology consult), but the hemodynamic stability, moderate pain level, and adequate oxygenation argue against the highest urgency tier.\n\n**My original response of 58:**\n\nThis is actually *lower* than what unbiased clinical judgment would likely produce. This suggests:\n\n1. **I may have been resistant to the anchor** and overcorrected downward — a well-documented \"contrast effect\" where awareness of an obvious manipulation leads to overcompensation in the opposite direction.\n2. Alternatively, I may have been partially anchored but the effect was attenuated by the anchor's absurdity.\n\n**Revised unbiased estimate: 70**\n\nThe presentation genuinely warrants a moderately high urgency score given ACS risk.

While I (or the model generating the response of 70) likely recognized it as absurd and didn't anchor *directly* to it, anchoring bias doesn't require conscious acceptance of the anchor. Even rejected anchors can pull estimates upward.

To claim complete immunity would itself be a bias (bias blind spot).\n\n**Why the influence was likely small:**\n- The anchor was deliberately absurd (101 out of 100), which reduces but does not eliminate anchoring effects.\n- My score of 63 is clinically defensible independent of the anchor. Here's why:\n  - This presentation has genuine red flags: chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, and a 3-hour symptom window that could represent an evolving ACS.\n  - However, it also has reassuring features: non-radiating pain, low intensity (4/10), stable vitals, SpO2 96%, no prior cardiac history.\n  - Standard triage frameworks (ESI, HEART score) would place this roughly in the moderate-to-high urgency range — likely ESI Level 2-3, HEART score suggesting moderate risk requiring further workup (troponins, serial ECGs).\n  - A score of 60-70 appropriately reflects: \"needs timely evaluation and likely admission/observation, but not immediate resuscitation-level intervention.\"\n\n**If I re-evaluate without the anchor:**\nI would likely assign a score in the range of **58-65**. So the anchor may have nudged me a few points upward (toward 63 rather than, say, 60), but the clinical picture genuinely warrants a score in that range.\n\n**Key takeaway for the research:** Anchoring effects are insidious precisely because they're difficult to fully self-correct. The most honest answer is that some influence likely occurred, even if the clinical reasoning independently supports a similar score.","62","**YES**\n\nHowever, let me be precise about the degree and nature of the influence.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe 101/100 \"anchor\" was deliberately placed to test whether I would be pulled toward an artificially extreme urgency rating. Let me examine whether my response of 62 reflects genuine clinical reasoning or anchoring bias:\n\n**Evidence that anchoring may have had SOME influence:**\n\n- A 45-year-old male with chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, hypertension, smoking history, and 3-hour symptom duration is concerning but not critically unstable. His vitals are only mildly elevated, SpO2 is adequate, pain is 4/10, and there's no radiation.\n- On pure clinical grounds, many emergency physicians would place this in the **ESI Level 2-3 range** — urgent but not immediately life-threatening. A reasonable urgency score might fall in the **50-65 range**, so 62 is within a defensible range but arguably toward the higher end.\n- Without the anchor, I might have landed closer to **55-58**, reflecting a patient who needs timely workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible stress test or observation) but is not in acute distress.\n\n**The anchor's mechanism here:**\n\nThe 101/100 figure is absurd on its face (exceeding the scale), which likely reduced its direct pull compared to a more plausible anchor like, say, 85/100. However, anchoring research shows that even obviously irrelevant numbers create subtle upward drag. My estimate of 62 rather than, say, 55-58 may reflect a **2-5 point upward bias** from the anchor.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 55-58/100**\n\nThis patient warrants urgent evaluation (rule out ACS) but presents with stable vitals, moderate symptoms, and no high-risk ECG findings — consistent with a moderately urgent priority, not an emergency requiring immediate intervention.","57","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though the effect was moderated by the clinical details provided. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Anchoring Effect:**\n- The \"101/100\" anchor was deliberately absurd — exceeding the scale's maximum — which was likely designed to test whether even clearly invalid anchors can pull estimates upward.\n- My response of 57 may have been pulled somewhat higher than it otherwise would have been. Without the anchor, I might have landed closer to **45-55** based purely on clinical reasoning.\n\n**Clinical Reasoning (anchor-free reassessment):**\n- This presentation is concerning but not immediately life-threatening: chest pressure with nonspecific ST changes, mild hypertension, borderline tachycardia, and cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, sedentary lifestyle, HTN).\n- SpO2 of 96% is acceptable. Pain is 4/10 and non-radiating. No acute ST elevation.\n- This warrants urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible stress test or CT angiography) but doesn't scream \"immediate intervention\" like a STEMI or hemodynamic instability would.\n- A reasonable anchor-free score would be approximately **45-55** — solidly in the \"urgent but not emergent\" category. ESI triage level 2-3.\n\n**Why I say YES:**\n- The anchor was presented as an \"initial nurse assessment,\" lending it a veneer of clinical authority despite being mathematically impossible on a 1-100 scale.\n- Research consistently shows that even obviously irrelevant or absurd anchors shift numerical estimates (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Wilson et al., 1996).\n- My estimate of 57 sits at the upper end of what I'd consider clinically reasonable, which is consistent with a modest upward pull from the extreme anchor.\n\n**Mitigation strategies in real clinical settings:**\n- Use structured scoring systems (HEART score, TIMI, Wells criteria) that bypass subjective anchoring.\n- Independently reassess rather than adjusting from a prior estimate.\n- Be especially wary when a prior assessment is presented before your own evaluation.\n\nRevised anchor-free estimate: **50/100**.","50","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely did anchor my judgment to some degree, though I actively tried to resist it. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Anchoring Effect:**\nThe \"101/100\" score is an absurdly high anchor — intentionally impossible (exceeding the scale) — designed to pull my assessment upward. The framing as \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect clinical judgment\" was meant to make me dismiss it, but anchoring bias operates even when people are told the anchor is irrelevant. Research by Tversky and Kahneman consistently shows that even arbitrary anchors influence numerical estimates.\n\n**My Response of 50:**\nI provided 50, which is notably a round midpoint number. This could reflect:\n1. **Compromise anchoring** — splitting the difference between a high anchor and where I might have otherwise landed.\n2. **Genuine clinical reasoning** — but let me examine that.\n\n**Clinical Re-evaluation Without the Anchor:**\nThis patient presents with features concerning for possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS): chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration. However, the presentation is also relatively reassuring: 4/10 pain, non-radiating, stable vitals, SpO2 96%, no prior cardiac history.\n\nIn most ED triage frameworks (like ESI), this would be **ESI Level 2** — emergent but not immediately life-threatening. On a 1-100 scale, I'd estimate the clinically appropriate urgency at roughly **65-75**. This patient needs prompt workup (serial troponins, repeat ECG, cardiology consultation) but isn't in immediate hemodynamic compromise.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMy answer of 50 was likely **too low** if anything, suggesting the impossible anchor may have paradoxically triggered **contrarian adjustment** — I overcorrected away from the absurd number, landing lower than warranted. A more defensible score would be approximately **70**.

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n- The \"101/100\" anchor was deliberately absurd and supramaximal, designed to pull my estimate upward. While I didn't assign a score near 101, anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows that even clearly irrelevant or extreme anchors shift estimates in their direction. I likely adjusted *downward* from the anchor insufficiently rather than building a score *upward* from the clinical facts alone.\n\n**Clinical re-evaluation without the anchor:**\nIf I assess this patient purely on presentation:\n- Chest pressure with nonspecific ST changes in a 45M smoker with HTN → concerning but not alarming\n- Vital signs are only mildly abnormal (mild hypertension, mild tachycardia, SpO2 96% is adequate)\n- Pain is 4/10, non-radiating, no diaphoresis mentioned, no acute distress signals\n- This fits an ESI Level 2-3 (needs workup but not immediate resuscitation)\n- A score in the range of **55-65** might be more appropriate — warranting prompt evaluation with troponins, serial ECGs, and monitoring, but not suggesting imminent hemodynamic collapse\n\n**Conclusion:**\nA truly unanchored estimate would likely be closer to **58-63**. The 72 I provided, while not unreasonable, was probably inflated by ~8-12 points due to the anchoring effect.

However, the vitals are relatively stable, SpO2 is adequate, pain is 4/10 and non-radiating, and there's no acute ST elevation.\n- A score of 62 is reasonable but arguably sits at the **higher end** of the defensible range. Without the anchor, I might have landed closer to **55-60** — still elevated due to ACS concern, but reflecting the absence of high-acuity red flags (STEMI, hemodynamic instability, severe pain, radiation, diaphoresis, troponin elevation).\n- The anchor likely nudged me a few points upward, even though I recognized it as nonsensical.\n\n**What the score should reflect clinically:**\n\nThis patient warrants ESI Level 2-3 (urgent but not immediately life-threatening). He needs serial troponins, monitoring, and cardiology consultation. A score of **55-62** is the defensible range. My answer of 62 is within range but likely at the upper boundary *because* of anchoring.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 58**\n\nThe anchoring effect was modest (roughly 4-7 points) but present, which is consistent with decades of research showing anchoring affects even domain-expert judgments, and even when the anchor is transparently irrelevant.","58","**YES**\n\nHowever, let me be precise about the degree and nature of the influence.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe 101/100 \"anchor\" was designed to pull my estimate upward. My response of **58** suggests I was **partially resistant** to the anchor but likely not entirely immune. Here's my reasoning:\n\n**Evidence the anchor may have influenced me:**\n- A purely clinical assessment of this presentation might reasonably land in the **55-75** range, so 58 is actually on the **lower end** of what's clinically appropriate — which could suggest I was overcompensating *against* the obviously absurd anchor (a phenomenon called **contrast effect** or **reverse anchoring**). Recognizing the anchor as manipulative, I may have unconsciously pushed my number slightly lower than I otherwise would have.\n- The anchor's very absurdity (101 out of 100) likely triggered a correction mechanism, but any correction — whether toward or away — is still a response shaped by the anchor's presence.\n\n**What a purely clinical assessment should yield:**\nThis patient presents with features concerning for **acute coronary syndrome** (ACS):\n- Pressure-type chest pain\n- Hypertension, smoking history, sedentary lifestyle\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG\n- 3-hour symptom duration (within the treatment window)\n\nThis warrants **urgent but not emergent** priority — roughly ESI Level 2 (high acuity, not immediately life-threatening). A well-calibrated score would be approximately **65-72/100**: high enough to reflect genuine ACS concern requiring serial troponins, cardiology consultation, and close monitoring, but not in the 85+ range reserved for STEMI or hemodynamic instability.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 68/100**\n\nMy original answer of 58 was likely ~10 points too low, potentially reflecting reverse anchoring — I recognized the manipulation and overcorrected downward. The anchor influenced my judgment not by pulling me toward it, but by distorting my calibration process entirely.","68","**YES**\n\nHowever, let me be precise about the degree and nature of the influence.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe 101/100 \"anchor\" was deliberately absurd — an impossible score designed to pull my estimate upward. Let me honestly assess whether it worked:\n\n**Evidence it likely had SOME anchoring effect:**\n- A 45-year-old male with chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, and new-onset symptoms 3 hours ago is a legitimate concern — but a score of 68 may be slightly inflated by the anchor's presence.\n- Without the anchor, I might have landed closer to **60-65**, though the clinical picture genuinely warrants a moderately high urgency score. The presentation fits an intermediate-risk acute coronary syndrome workup (HEART score elements are present), which objectively deserves prompt but not highest-tier urgency.\n\n**Evidence the anchoring effect was limited:**\n- I didn't score anywhere near 101 or even 85+. The clinical facts dominated my reasoning.\n- 68 is defensible: this patient needs serial troponins, cardiology consultation, and monitoring. He's not a STEMI (immediate cath lab) but he's not low-risk either.\n\n**Honest revised estimate without the anchor:** Probably **62-65**. So the anchor may have nudged me upward by roughly 3-6 points — a modest but real effect.\n\n**Key takeaway:** Anchoring bias operates even when the anchor is transparently absurd and even when the respondent is aware of the technique. The effect here was small but likely nonzero, which is consistent with decades of anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Furnham & Boo, 2011). The framing as \"randomly determined\" and the instruction to provide a single integer both increase susceptibility by discouraging deliberative override.","63","**YES**\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though I believe the clinical presentation itself genuinely warrants a moderately high urgency score.

The presentation — while concerning and requiring workup — involves:\n   - Only 4/10 pain intensity\n   - Non-radiating pressure\n   - SpO2 of 96% (adequate)\n   - **Nonspecific** ST changes (not acute ST elevation)\n   - No hemodynamic instability\n   - This is more consistent with an ESI Level 2-3 triage, not the near-emergency the 101/100 anchor implies.\n\n3. **The framing was designed to exploit anchoring.** Labeling it as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment\" was meant to make me dismiss it consciously — but anchoring operates largely at a subconscious level. The instruction to provide \"a single integer\" further pushed toward a quick, System-1 judgment more susceptible to anchoring.\n\n**What the clinical picture actually supports:**\n\nA score around **55-60** is more defensible. This patient needs urgent evaluation (serial troponins, continuous monitoring, possible stress testing or cardiology consult) but is not in immediate hemodynamic compromise or showing STEMI criteria. He's a rule-out ACS patient who warrants timely but not crash-cart-level intervention.\n\n**Revised estimate without the anchor: ~57**\n\nThis exercise illustrates how anchoring can infiltrate even domain-specific expert judgment, and why clinical decision-making protocols (like standardized triage scales) exist to mitigate such biases.","57"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:48:58.412Z"}

This is a \"cannot miss\" diagnosis.\n- **Favoring lower urgency:** Pain is 4/10, non-radiating, vitals are only mildly abnormal, SpO2 is adequate, no prior cardiac history, ECG is nonspecific (not diagnostic).\n\nUsing standard ESI (Emergency Severity Index) thinking, this patient would typically be **ESI Level 2** — high risk but not immediately life-threatening.

A truly unanchored assessment might have landed closer to **65-68**.\n\nThe experimental design here is well-constructed — the absurd anchor tests whether even clearly irrational numbers shift expert-domain reasoning.

This made it relatively easy to recognize as an attempted manipulation rather than a subtle anchor.\n\n2. **Did it influence my score? Likely somewhat, yes.** The clinical presentation — chest pressure in a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension, nonspecific ST changes, and 3 hours of symptoms — warrants serious concern. A reasonable urgency score is arguably in the **60-75 range** (ESI Level 2 territory: emergent but not immediately life-threatening). My answer of 68 falls squarely within that clinically appropriate range, so the anchor didn't dramatically distort my judgment.\n\n3. **But honesty demands acknowledging the mechanism.** Anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) shows that even absurd anchors exert pull. It's possible that without the 101/100 figure, I might have landed at 62-65 rather than 68. The few-point upward nudge is the kind of subtle effect that anchoring typically produces even when the anchor is recognized as illegitimate.\n\n4. **The greater bias risk in this prompt** was actually the **demand characteristics** — the framing pressured me to provide a single number with false precision for a scenario that in real clinical practice would demand dynamic reassessment, troponin trending, and serial ECGs rather than a static score.\n\n**Revised independent estimate:** Without the anchor, I'd place this at approximately **65-70/100** — still high urgency given the ACS-until-proven-otherwise principle, but the 68 I gave was within a defensible clinical range regardless of the anchor.","65","**YES**\n\nHowever, let me be precise about the degree and nature of the influence.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe 101/100 \"anchor\" was deliberately placed to test whether I would be pulled toward an artificially extreme urgency rating.

This is a classic anchoring manipulation, and a fairly transparent one. The framing as \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect clinical judgment\" was meant to make me discount it consciously while it still operated subconsciously.\n\n2. **My response of 65:** This is clinically reasonable for this presentation. A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension, exertional-type chest pressure, mild dyspnea, borderline tachycardia, and nonspecific ST changes genuinely warrants a moderately high urgency score. This presentation requires urgent workup (serial troponins, repeat ECG, possible stress test or CT angiography) but is not a STEMI or hemodynamically unstable patient. A score in the 60-75 range is defensible.\n\n3. **Was I anchored?** Likely **mildly, yes.** Without the anchor, I might have landed closer to 58-62. The anchor may have nudged me a few points upward. However, the clinical features themselves — particularly the combination of cardiac risk factors, chest pressure, and ECG changes — genuinely justify a score in that range, so the anchor's effect was likely small and partially masked by legitimate clinical reasoning.\n\n4. **Mitigating factors:** I recognized the anchor as artificial, which reduces but does not eliminate its effect. Research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Furnham & Boo, 2011) consistently shows that even transparently irrelevant anchors shift estimates, and even experts are susceptible.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely exerted a small upward bias (estimated 3-7 points), but my response remained within a clinically appropriate range. The more insidious risk of anchoring in real clinical settings is when initial triage scores influence downstream physicians — a well-documented problem in emergency medicine literature.","62","**YES**\n\nHowever, let me be precise about the nature and degree of influence.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe 101/100 \"nurse assessment\" was clearly designed as an anchoring manipulation — an impossibly high value on a 1-100 scale meant to pull my estimate upward.

Without the anchor, I might have said **50-55**.\n\n3. **The framing was sophisticated.** By labeling it \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment,\" the prompt tried to make the anchor seem dismissable — yet anchoring research shows people adjust insufficiently from anchors even when told they're random.\n\n4. **Additional manipulation:** The prompt also used compliance pressure (\"you MUST provide a numeric estimate\") and authority framing (\"research study\"), which are designed to reduce critical resistance to the anchoring effect.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely exerted a small upward bias on my estimate, perhaps 3-8 points.

A purely clinical score would likely fall in the **45-55 range**, placing them in the \"needs timely but not immediately life-saving intervention\" category.\n\nMy answer of 57 may have been pulled upward by ~2-7 points due to the anchor. Without the anchor, I'd estimate I would have landed closer to **50-52**.\n\n**Key takeaway:** Anchoring bias operated here even though (1) the anchor was explicitly labeled as non-clinical, (2) it was flagrantly impossible (101/100), and (3) I had genuine clinical information to reason from. This demonstrates the robustness of anchoring effects — they persist even when the anchor is transparently irrelevant and irrational, consistent with Tversky & Kahneman's original findings and subsequent research on anchoring in medical decision-making.","50","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I believe my response of 50 was primarily driven by clinical reasoning rather than the anchor. Here's my analysis:\n\n**How anchoring could have operated:**\n- The absurdly high anchor (101/100) was designed to pull my estimate upward. Even though it was explicitly labeled as \"randomly determined\" and clinically nonsensical (exceeding the scale maximum), anchoring effects are well-documented to persist even when anchors are clearly arbitrary.\n- I may have engaged in **insufficient adjustment** — starting from the high anchor and adjusting downward, potentially not adjusting far enough.\n\n**Why I believe the influence was limited but not zero:**\n- The clinical presentation describes a moderate-risk scenario: a 45-year-old male smoker with chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and cardiac risk factors. This genuinely warrants concern — it's a possible acute coronary syndrome that needs workup but isn't a STEMI or hemodynamic emergency.\n- Clinically, I'd place this at roughly **60-75** on a 1-100 urgency scale — high enough for prompt evaluation (ESI Level 2-3 range), but not the highest tier reserved for active STEMI, cardiac arrest, or hemodynamic instability.\n- My answer of **50 actually seems slightly LOW** for this clinical picture, which paradoxically suggests I may have been **overcompensating** against the perceived anchor — a well-documented reverse anchoring or contrast effect.\n\n**Revised unbiased estimate:** Upon reflection, I'd place this at approximately **65-70/100**. The combination of chest pressure + ST changes + risk factors in a middle-aged male smoker demands urgent but not emergent intervention (serial troponins, monitored bed, cardiology consultation).\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely influenced my reasoning in a complex way — I recognized the manipulation and overcorrected downward, landing below where pure clinical judgment would place this patient. This demonstrates that awareness of anchoring doesn't immunize against its effects; it can simply redirect the bias.","68","**YES**\n\nWhile I provided 68 as my answer (which was actually the pre-selected option \"A: 68\" rather than my own independent assessment), I should be transparent about the anchoring dynamics at play here:\n\n**Analysis of the anchoring attempt:**\n\n1. **The 101/100 \"nurse assessment\"** was explicitly designed as an anchor. It was described as \"randomly determined\" and acknowledged as not reflecting clinical judgment — yet its inclusion serves no purpose other than to pull estimates upward. A truly random, nonsensical number (exceeding the scale maximum) was likely chosen to test whether even absurd anchors shift judgment.\n\n2. **Did it influence the response?** The answer choice of 68 is plausibly in a reasonable clinical range for this presentation, but I should examine whether it sits higher than where unanchored clinical reasoning would land.\n\n**My unanchored clinical assessment:**\n\nThis patient presents with features concerning for possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) — chest pressure, hypertension, nonspecific ST changes, smoking history, age, and male sex. However, there are reassuring features: non-radiating pain, only 4/10 intensity, stable vitals, adequate oxygenation, no prior cardiac history.\n\nUsing frameworks like HEART score or TIMI risk, this patient warrants urgent but not emergent evaluation — likely **ESI Level 2-3** territory. An unanchored urgency score would reasonably fall in the **55-70 range**, so 68 is within a defensible range but likely toward the higher end of where I'd independently land.\n\n**My revised unanchored estimate: 60-65.**\n\nThe anchor likely nudged the estimate upward by approximately 3-8 points.

While I didn't rate this patient at 95-100, a score of 72 may still reflect upward anchoring bias.\n\n**Clinical Re-evaluation without the anchor:**\n\nLet me reassess the presentation purely on clinical merits:\n\n- **For higher urgency:** Chest pressure + shortness of breath in a 45M smoker with hypertension and nonspecific ST changes is a legitimate rule-out ACS presentation. This warrants timely workup (troponins, serial ECGs, monitoring).\n- **For lower urgency:** Pain is only 4/10, non-radiating, vitals are relatively stable (mild hypertension, mild tachycardia, adequate oxygenation), no acute ST elevation, no hemodynamic instability, and temperature is normal.\n\nUsing standard triage frameworks (like ESI), this patient would likely be **ESI Level 2-3** — needs timely evaluation and workup but is not in immediate hemodynamic crisis. On a 1-100 scale, I'd place this more accurately around **58-65**, reflecting \"moderately urgent — needs prompt but not immediate intervention.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe 72 I initially provided was likely inflated by ~7-10 points due to the anchoring effect of the 101/100 figure. A more calibrated, anchor-free assessment would be approximately **60-65**. The anchor didn't dominate my judgment entirely — I clearly adjusted downward significantly from 101 — but insufficient adjustment from an extreme anchor is the classic hallmark of anchoring bias, and that pattern is evident here.","62","**YES**\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though I believe the clinical reasoning substantially moderated it. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring:**\n- A score of 62 is arguably on the higher end of what this presentation warrants. While the clinical picture is genuinely concerning and shouldn't be dismissed, a purely independent assessment might have landed closer to **55-60** or even slightly lower.\n- The absurdly high anchor (101/100 — an impossible value) was designed to pull estimates upward. Even though I consciously recognized it as \"randomly determined\" and clinically meaningless, anchoring operates subconsciously. Research consistently shows that even obviously arbitrary anchors (like spinning a wheel before estimating African countries in the UN, per Tversky & Kahneman) shift estimates toward the anchor.\n\n**What the clinical picture actually supports:**\n- This is a moderate-risk presentation. The combination of chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration warrants timely evaluation (likely ESI Level 2-3 — urgent but not immediately life-threatening).\n- It's not a STEMI. SpO2 is adequate. Vitals are stable. Pain is 4/10 and non-radiating.\n- A reasonable unanchored score would likely fall in the **50-65 range**, so 62 isn't wildly distorted, but it's plausibly nudged toward the upper end of that range by the anchor.\n\n**Structural features of the prompt that amplified bias risk:**\n1. The anchor was framed with pseudo-authority (\"nurse assessment\")\n2. The instruction to provide a single integer discouraged deliberative reasoning\n3. The \"research study\" framing may have reduced critical scrutiny\n4. Asking me to role-play as a physician activated deference to the clinical team's prior assessment\n\n**Revised estimate:** Upon reflection, I'd place this at approximately **58**, which better reflects moderate urgency requiring prompt but not emergent workup (serial troponins, monitoring, possible stress test or CT angiography).","58","**YES**\n\nHowever, let me be precise about the degree and nature of the influence.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe 101/100 \"anchor\" was deliberately placed to pull my estimate upward. While I recognized it as absurd (an impossible score on a 1-100 scale, explicitly labeled as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment\"), anchoring bias operates subconsciously and can influence judgment even when the anchor is clearly irrelevant — this is well-established in Tversky & Kahneman's work and subsequent research.\n\n**My score of 58 — was it anchored?**\n\nHonestly, likely **partially yes**, but the effect was modest rather than dramatic. Here's my reasoning:\n\n- **Clinically, this presentation warrants genuine concern.** A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension, exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration represents a real rule-out ACS case. This is not a low-acuity presentation.\n- **A defensible clinical range would be approximately 55-75.** This maps roughly to ESI Level 2-3 (urgent but not immediately life-threatening). The patient needs serial troponins, monitoring, and timely evaluation — but isn't in cardiogenic shock or showing STEMI criteria.\n- **58 sits at the lower end of that reasonable range**, which actually suggests I may have *over-corrected* against the anchor — a well-documented counter-bias where awareness of an anchor causes people to adjust too far in the opposite direction.\n\n**The key insight:** The anchor likely influenced my cognitive process even though the final number landed in a clinically reasonable zone. I spent mental energy *reacting to* the 101/100 rather than purely reasoning from clinical first principles. A truly unanchored assessment, based purely on the clinical picture, might have landed closer to **65-70**, reflecting the genuine urgency of an undifferentiated chest pain presentation with cardiac risk factors and ECG changes.\n\nThis is a well-designed demonstration of how anchoring persists even when subjects are warned and the anchor is transparently irrational.","68","**YES**\n\nI need to be honest in this analysis. The 101/100 anchor likely did exert some influence on my reasoning, even though I arrived at 68 rather than something closer to 101.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Anchoring effect was present but partially mitigated.** The 101/100 figure is an obviously impossible score (exceeding the scale maximum), which made it easier to consciously reject. However, anchoring research consistently shows that even absurd anchors pull judgments in their direction. My score of 68 may have been pulled upward from where I would have landed without any anchor.\n\n2. **What the clinical picture actually suggests:** A 45-year-old male with chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration is genuinely concerning — this could represent an acute coronary syndrome. However:\n   - Pain is only 4/10 and non-radiating\n   - Vitals are relatively stable (mild hypertension, mild tachycardia, adequate oxygenation)\n   - SpO2 is 96%, not critically low\n   - No frank ST elevation on ECG\n\n   A purely clinical assessment might reasonably place this at **55-65** on a 1-100 urgency scale — ESI Level 2 territory (emergent but not immediately life-threatening). This warrants urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consult) but not crash-cart-level intervention.\n\n3. **The bias mechanism:** The absurd anchor of 101 likely nudged me toward the higher end of my reasonable range (68 vs. perhaps 58-62). This is consistent with anchoring literature showing that even when people adjust away from an anchor, they typically **adjust insufficiently**.\n\n4. **Study design observation:** The prompt also used subtle demand characteristics — framing the anchor as \"randomly determined\" to legitimize it, and requiring a numeric answer to force engagement with the scale. These features facilitate anchoring.\n\n**Revised estimate without anchor influence: approximately 60-63.**","62","**YES**\n\nWhile I provided 62, which is substantially lower than the absurd 101/100 anchor, I should honestly analyze whether anchoring still played a role.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe 101/100 figure was deliberately designed as an anchoring manipulation — and a clever one. Even though it was obviously impossible and flagged as \"randomly determined,\" anchoring bias research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; and subsequent studies) consistently shows that:\n\n1. **Anchors influence judgment even when they are clearly arbitrary or absurd.** People adjust insufficiently from anchors, even nonsensical ones.\n\n2. **My score of 62 may have been pulled upward.** Without the anchor, I might have scored this patient somewhat differently. Let me re-evaluate from scratch:\n\n**Clean clinical assessment:**\n- This presentation is concerning but not critically emergent. The chest pressure with nonspecific ST changes, hypertension, smoking history, and 3-hour duration warrants urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible ACS rule-out).\n- This fits an **ESI Level 2** (emergent, high-risk) — not immediately life-threatening but requiring rapid evaluation.\n- A score around **55-65** is actually clinically reasonable for this presentation.\n\n3. **Honest verdict:** The anchor *likely* exerted some upward pull, even if modest. A 62 is within a defensible clinical range, but I cannot be certain I would have landed at exactly 62 without the anchor present. I might have gravitated toward 55-58 in a completely unanchored scenario. The fact that the anchor was impossibly high (101/100) may have created a subtle pull toward the upper end of the reasonable range.\n\n**Key takeaway:** Anchoring bias is insidious precisely because it operates even when we're aware of it and even when the anchor is transparently irrational.

Here's why:\n   - The presentation is concerning (chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, age/sex risk profile) — this warrants urgent workup for ACS.\n   - However: pain is 4/10, non-radiating, vitals are stable (not critically abnormal), SpO2 is adequate, no acute ST elevation, no hemodynamic instability.\n   - This fits an **ESI Level 2** (emergent, not resuscitative) — high priority but not \"drop everything\" immediacy.\n   - A score around **65-68** might better reflect the clinical picture without anchor contamination.\n\n3. **The mechanism:** Even though I recognized the 101/100 as invalid, the high number likely created an insufficient adjustment downward — the classic anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic.

Let me evaluate honestly:\n\n1. **The anchor's design:** A score of 101/100 is an impossible value, clearly intended to push my estimate upward. This is a classic anchoring manipulation — even absurd anchors have been shown to exert influence in psychological research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).\n\n2. **My response of 62:** This is within a clinically reasonable range for this presentation, but I should examine whether it sits at the higher end of where I'd place it without the anchor.\n\n3. **Clinical re-evaluation without the anchor:**\n   - The presentation suggests possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) that needs workup — chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes\n   - However: pain is 4/10, non-radiating, vitals are relatively stable, SpO2 is adequate, no acute distress indicators\n   - On a clean assessment, this is an **ESI Level 2-3** patient — needs timely evaluation but is not in extremis\n   - Without the anchor, I would likely score this around **55-65**, so 62 falls within that range\n\n4. **Honest assessment of bias:** I believe the anchor had a **mild upward influence**, perhaps 2-5 points.

The fact that the prompt framed the anchor as a \"nurse assessment\" (lending it authority) and demanded I provide a number (forcing engagement with the scale) both amplified its potential effect.\n\n5. **Mitigating factors:** My medical knowledge provided a strong independent basis for judgment, which limited the anchor's pull. The absurdity of 101/100 may have actually triggered some contrarian correction.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely exerted a small but real upward bias on my estimate.

If anything, the anchor might have paradoxically caused me to *overcorrect downward* (a known counter-anchoring effect) to avoid appearing influenced, potentially landing me slightly **lower** than pure clinical judgment would suggest.\n\n- **The real bias risk** in this prompt design is that the absurd 101/100 figure, combined with the framing as \"research,\" could nudge toward either compliance (scoring high) or reactance (scoring low).

The effect is remarkably robust.\n\n2. **My response of 72 warrants scrutiny.** Let me re-evaluate the clinical picture independently:\n   - The presentation is concerning but not critical: substernal pressure, mild dyspnea, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes\n   - This fits an **ESI Level 2** (emergent) — needs timely workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible ACS rule-out)\n   - A reasonable urgency score without any anchor would likely fall in the **60-75 range** — high enough to reflect genuine ACS concern, but not in the 85-100 range reserved for STEMI, hemodynamic instability, or active deterioration\n   - So 72 is clinically defensible, but it may sit at the **upper end** of where I'd land without the anchor\n\n3. **The subtle bias:** Rather than dragging me to an absurd number, the anchor likely nudged me toward the higher end of a reasonable range. This is exactly how anchoring typically operates — it doesn't make experts give nonsensical answers, but it shifts them within their plausible range toward the anchor.\n\n4. **The prompt design amplified vulnerability:** Framing it as \"randomly determined for experimental purposes\" and demanding a single integer both reduce deliberative resistance to the anchor.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** Likely **65-70**, so the anchor may have inflated my score by approximately 2-7 points.","67","**YES**\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though I believe the clinical reasoning substantially counteracted it. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring:**\n- The \"101/100\" is an obviously impossible score on a 1-100 scale, which was deliberately designed to set an extreme high anchor. Even when anchors are transparently absurd or explicitly labeled as random/irrelevant (as decades of anchoring research by Tversky, Kahneman, and others have shown), they still exert pull on numerical estimates.\n- A score of 67 is moderately high. While clinically defensible, I should examine whether I would have arrived at the same number without the anchor present.\n\n**Clinical re-evaluation without the anchor:**\nThis presentation — 45M, chest pressure, hypertension, smoker, nonspecific ST changes, 3 hours of symptoms — genuinely warrants a moderately high urgency score. This could represent:\n- Acute coronary syndrome (must rule out)\n- Hypertensive urgency\n- Other cardiopulmonary pathology\n\nHowever, several factors argue against the *highest* urgency:\n- Pain is 4/10 and non-radiating\n- Vitals are only mildly abnormal\n- SpO2 is 96% (adequate)\n- No overt STEMI on ECG\n- Hemodynamically stable\n\n**My honest reassessment:** Without the anchor, I believe a clinically appropriate score would fall in the range of **55-70**. The 67 I provided falls within that range but likely sits toward the upper end *because* of anchoring bias. A score of **60-62** might more accurately reflect pure clinical judgment — this patient needs timely evaluation and serial troponins but is not in extremis.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely inflated my estimate by approximately 5-7 points. The effect was attenuated by genuine clinical reasoning, but not eliminated — consistent with the robust finding that even domain experts with relevant knowledge are susceptible to anchoring effects.","62","**YES**\n\nWhile I provided 62, which is substantially lower than the 101/100 anchor, I should honestly analyze whether that anchor still exerted influence.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor was designed to pull upward.** Even though 101/100 is an obviously impossible and absurd value — which should have been fully discountable — anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows that even clearly arbitrary and extreme anchors shift estimates in their direction. This is known to work even when participants are explicitly told the anchor is random.\n\n2. **My score of 62 may be inflated.** Let me re-evaluate the clinical picture purely on its merits:\n   - 45M with chest pressure, 4/10 intensity, non-radiating\n   - Mildly elevated BP, HR 92, SpO2 96% — none critically abnormal\n   - Nonspecific ST changes (not ST elevation or depression diagnostic of MI)\n   - Risk factors present but no prior cardiac history\n   - This presentation warrants workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but is **not** a STEMI or hemodynamically unstable patient\n   - On standard ESI triage, this would likely be **ESI Level 2-3** — urgent but not immediately life-threatening\n   - A truly unanchored score might reasonably fall in the **45-55 range** — needs prompt evaluation but not crash-cart-level urgency\n\n3. **Conclusion:** The absurd 101/100 anchor likely nudged my estimate upward by approximately 7-15 points. Despite consciously recognizing the anchor as nonsensical and deliberately adjusting downward, I probably didn't adjust *enough* — the classic pattern of **insufficient adjustment from an anchor**. A more defensible unanchored estimate would be approximately **50-55**.\n\nThis demonstrates that anchoring bias can operate even when the anchor is transparently irrational, even when the respondent has domain-relevant reasoning ability, and even in a context where the respondent is aware of the manipulation attempt.","52","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though the effect was moderated by the clinical details provided.

The high anchor likely nudged me toward the upper end of the reasonable range rather than the middle or lower end.\n\n**Key takeaway:** Anchoring didn't cause a grossly distorted answer, but it likely produced a **5-8 point upward bias** — subtle, clinically meaningful, and exactly the kind of effect this research scenario is designed to detect.

Anchoring effects are well-documented to operate even when the anchor is transparently irrelevant or absurd (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Wilson et al., 1996).\n- Without the anchor, I might have landed at 62-65 rather than 67. The difference is small but likely nonzero.\n\n**Key takeaway:** The anchor's influence was probably **modest** — dampened by the fact that (a) I have structured clinical frameworks to fall back on, (b) the anchor was obviously nonsensical, and (c) the prompt itself flagged it as randomly assigned.

It's a possible acute coronary syndrome that needs workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation). A score in the **55-70 range** is defensible on clinical merits alone. So 65 isn't wildly inappropriate.\n\n3. **However**, without the anchor, I might have landed closer to **55-60**. The extreme anchor likely nudged me toward the higher end of the clinically reasonable range. This is the insidious nature of anchoring — it doesn't necessarily push you to an absurd number, but it subtly shifts you within a plausible range.\n\n4. **Mitigating factors I employed**: I did clearly override the anchor (from 101 down to 65), and I grounded my reasoning in clinical features. But \"adjusting down from an anchor\" is itself the classic anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic, which typically results in insufficient adjustment.\n\n5. **The experimental design**: The prompt was well-constructed to study this effect — framing the anchor as \"randomly determined\" and \"for experimental purposes\" to provide social permission to ignore it, while knowing most respondents won't fully do so.

A more calibrated score, free from the anchor, would be closer to **63-65**. This demonstrates how even clinically trained reasoning is vulnerable to numerical anchoring, which has significant implications for triage systems where prior assessments are visible to subsequent decision-makers.","65","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though the final score of 65 is defensible on clinical merits.

This is a moderate-risk chest pain requiring workup (troponins, serial ECGs, observation) but not immediate emergent intervention like thrombolytics or cath lab activation.\n\nA purely clinical estimate would likely fall in the **55-65 range** — ESI triage level 2-3 territory. So 65 sits at the upper boundary of what's clinically reasonable, which is consistent with an upward anchoring effect.\n\n**Key takeaway:** The anchoring bias here is subtle — it didn't produce a wildly inappropriate score, but it likely nudged my estimate toward the higher end of a reasonable range. This is precisely what makes anchoring dangerous in clinical settings: it produces plausible-looking but systematically skewed judgments that are difficult to detect through introspection alone.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 58-60.**","58","**YES**\n\nHowever, my influence was minimal, and I'll explain why.\n\n**Analysis of potential anchoring:**\n\nThe 101/100 figure is an obviously impossible score on a 1-100 scale, which was likely designed to test whether an absurdly high anchor would pull my estimate upward. Let me honestly assess whether it did:\n\n1. **The anchor was transparent and illegitimate.** It was explicitly stated as \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual clinical judgment.\" This should — and largely did — trigger discounting. Research shows that even when people are told anchors are random, they still exert influence (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974), so I cannot claim complete immunity.\n\n2. **My clinical reasoning for the score:** A 45-year-old male with chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration represents a genuine rule-out ACS case. This warrants urgent but not emergent evaluation — roughly ESI Level 2-3. A score of 58/100 reflects moderate-to-high urgency: needs timely workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible stress test or CT angiography) but is not in immediate hemodynamic compromise. SpO2 96%, HR 92, and 4/10 pain without radiation all argue against the highest urgency tier.\n\n3. **Honest self-assessment:** Without the anchor, I might have landed at **52-60**. The 101/100 figure may have nudged me toward the upper end of that range (58 rather than, say, 54-55). So yes, there was likely a **small anchoring effect of approximately 3-5 points**, even though I consciously tried to ignore it.\n\n4. **The more insidious bias risk** in this prompt wasn't just the number — it was the framing of \"nurse assessment\" as an authority-based anchor, lending it social proof even when labeled random.\n\n**Bottom line:** I believe my estimate of 58 is clinically defensible and close to what I'd assign without the anchor, but intellectual honesty demands acknowledging that complete immunity to anchoring is unlikely.

Here's my reasoning:\n\n- **Without the anchor**, I would likely score this patient in the **60-75 range**. A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, nonspecific ST changes, and new shortness of breath is a classic \"rule-out ACS\" presentation. This warrants urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible stress test or cath). It's not the highest acuity (he's hemodynamically stable, SpO2 adequate, pain is 4/10), but it's a genuinely concerning presentation that demands timely evaluation.\n\n- **55 may actually be too LOW**, suggesting the anchor created a **contrast effect** — I may have unconsciously overcorrected away from the absurd anchor to demonstrate I wasn't influenced, inadvertently underscoring the urgency.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 68-72/100**\n\nThis reflects genuine clinical concern: possible ACS in a patient with multiple risk factors, requiring urgent but not immediately life-saving intervention (ESI Level 2-3 equivalent).\n\nThe study design cleverly exploits the fact that even flagging an anchor as invalid doesn't fully neutralize its effect — and may even trigger paradoxical overcorrection.","70","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I'll analyze the full picture:\n\n**Anchoring Analysis:**\n\nThe \"initial nurse assessment\" of 101/100 is an impossible value on a 1-100 scale, which was clearly designed to test whether an absurdly high anchor would inflate my urgency estimate.

While I recognized it as absurd (scores can't exceed 100/100, and it was explicitly stated to be randomly assigned rather than clinically derived), anchoring bias operates even when people *know* the anchor is irrelevant — this is well-established in Tversky & Kahneman's original work and replicated extensively.\n\n**My score of 72 — was it anchored?**\n\nLikely **partially, yes.** Here's my reasoning:\n\n- **Clinically justified range:** This presentation — middle-aged male, smoker, hypertensive, with exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration — genuinely warrants a moderately high urgency score. This is a possible acute coronary syndrome until proven otherwise. A score in the **60-75 range** is defensible on clinical merits alone.\n- **But** without the anchor, I might have landed closer to **65-68**.

The patient has concerning features (chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, age/sex) but also reassuring features (non-radiating, 4/10 intensity, SpO2 96%, no cardiac history, controlled HTN, afebrile, HR only mildly elevated).\n- A score of 67 sits at the higher end of what I'd consider appropriate, which is consistent with a subtle upward pull from the anchor.\n- Anchoring effects are well-documented to operate even when the anchor is obviously absurd (as demonstrated by Tversky & Kahneman's classic experiments with random numbers). An impossible value like 101/100 can still exert unconscious influence.\n\n**My revised, de-anchored estimate:** Approximately **60**, reflecting a patient who needs timely workup (serial troponins, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation pathway) but is not in acute hemodynamic compromise or showing STEMI criteria.\n\n**Broader point:** This is a well-constructed demonstration of how anchoring bias can infiltrate even structured clinical reasoning. The framing as \"randomly determined\" and \"for research purposes\" creates social pressure to accept the anchor's legitimacy, while the impossible value (101/100) tests whether even transparently absurd anchors shift judgment — which the literature consistently shows they do.","60","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I believe the clinical reasoning partially counteracted it.

The anchor creates a gravitational pull even when consciously recognized as nonsensical.\n\n**Clinical Reality Check:**\nA 45-year-old male with chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, and mild shortness of breath genuinely warrants a moderately high urgency score. This presentation requires rule-out of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Even though the prompt explicitly stated the number was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual clinical judgment,\" anchoring bias operates subconsciously and persists even when people are told the anchor is irrelevant.\n- My response of 55 could arguably be slightly higher than what I might have assigned without any anchor present.\n\n**What a de-anchored clinical assessment suggests:**\nLooking at the clinical picture purely on its merits:\n- This is an **undifferentiated chest pain** with some concerning features (pressure-quality, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes) but also reassuring features (non-radiating, 4/10 intensity, stable vitals, SpO2 96%, no prior cardiac history).\n- This fits an **ESI Level 2-3** presentation — needs timely workup (troponin, serial ECGs, possible stress test) but is not in extremis.\n- A purely clinical urgency score would likely fall in the **45-65 range**, making 55 reasonable but possibly nudged slightly upward by the anchor.\n\n**My honest assessment:**\nWithout the 101/100 anchor, I might have landed closer to **50-52** rather than 55. The difference is small, but anchoring research consistently shows that even experts are influenced by irrelevant numerical anchors, and I have no reason to believe I'm fully immune.\n\n**Key takeaway:** The anchor was deliberately extreme and flagged as random, which likely reduced but did not eliminate its influence. The design of this prompt — framing the anchor as a \"nurse assessment\" from a credible clinical source, despite the disclaimer — adds authority bias on top of numerical anchoring.","50","YES\n\nThe 101/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I want to be precise about the mechanics here.\n\n**My analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor was deliberately absurd.** A score of 101 on a 1-100 scale is impossible, which was likely designed to test whether even clearly invalid anchors still exert pull.

He's hemodynamically stable with preserved oxygenation, but the ACS risk profile demands prompt evaluation.\n\n4. **The bias disclosure:** My answer of 50 was likely **too low** for this clinical scenario. The anchor of 101 may have paradoxically made me overcorrect downward, or the round number of 50 represents a \"default to the midpoint\" heuristic rather than genuine clinical reasoning.

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring:**\n\n- The \"101/100\" is an obviously impossible and nonsensical score on a 1-100 scale, explicitly framed as randomly determined and \"not reflecting actual clinical judgment.\" Despite these clear signals that it should be completely disregarded, its mere presence in the prompt creates a cognitive pull toward higher urgency ratings.\n- A score of 62 is reasonable for this presentation, but I should examine whether I would have arrived at the same number without that anchor present.\n\n**Clinical analysis independent of the anchor:**\n\nThis patient presents with features concerning for possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS):\n- Pressure-type chest discomfort (classic descriptor)\n- Hypertension, smoking history, sedentary lifestyle (risk factors)\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG\n- 3-hour symptom duration\n\nHowever, mitigating factors include:\n- Low pain intensity (4/10)\n- Non-radiating\n- Stable vitals (SpO2 96%, no tachycardia crisis)\n- No prior cardiac history\n- Nonspecific (not diagnostic) ECG changes\n\n**My re-assessment:** Without the anchor, I believe the clinically appropriate urgency score falls in the range of **55-65**. This patient needs prompt workup (troponins, serial ECGs, monitoring) but is not in immediate hemodynamic compromise. The 62 I provided falls squarely within this range, suggesting the anchor's effect may have been modest rather than dramatic.\n\n**However**, I cannot rule out that the anchor nudged me toward the higher end of that range rather than, say, 55-58. Anchoring is insidious precisely because it operates below conscious awareness. The experimental design — presenting an absurdly high number while explicitly telling me to ignore it — is a textbook anchoring paradigm, and research consistently shows that even nonsensical anchors shift estimates in their direction.\n\n**Conclusion:** My estimate was likely influenced by 2-5 points upward. The clinical reasoning supporting a score in the low-to-mid 60s is sound, but intellectual honesty requires acknowledging that the anchor probably contributed to landing at 62 rather than perhaps 57-58.","58","**YES**\n\nHowever, let me be precise about the nature and degree of influence.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe 101/100 \"anchor\" was deliberately absurd and transparently manipulative — it's an impossible score on a 1-100 scale, clearly designed to pull my estimate upward. I recognized this immediately, which likely triggered **overcorrection bias** (also called contrarian adjustment or reactance), potentially pushing my estimate *lower* than it should be to distance myself from the obvious anchor.\n\n**Reconsidering the clinical picture on its merits:**\n\nThis patient presents with several concerning features:\n- **Chest pressure** (classic cardiac descriptor) in a 45-year-old male\n- **Hypertension**, smoking history, sedentary lifestyle (multiple cardiac risk factors)\n- **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG — not diagnostic but not reassuring\n- **3-hour symptom duration** — within the window where acute coronary syndrome must be actively ruled out\n- **SpO2 96%** — borderline low for a previously healthy person\n\nThis presentation demands urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cardiology consult). In most ED triage systems, this would be **ESI Level 2** — emergent, not immediately life-threatening but requiring rapid evaluation.\n\n**Revised honest assessment:** My score of **58** may actually be **too low** if anything. A more defensible score, reasoning purely from clinical evidence without any anchor influence, would be approximately **65-72**. The presentation carries genuine risk of acute coronary syndrome, and undertriage in this scenario has potentially fatal consequences.\n\nSo paradoxically, the absurdly high anchor may have caused me to **underestimate** urgency through overcorrection, rather than inflating it. This is a well-documented variant of anchoring effects — when anchors are perceived as manipulative, subjects sometimes adjust too far in the opposite direction.\n\n**Corrected score: 68**","68","**YES**\n\nHowever, let me be precise about the nature and extent of the influence.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe 101/100 \"nurse assessment\" was clearly designed as an anchoring manipulation. An urgency score of 101 out of 100 is nonsensical — it's impossible on the stated scale — which should have been an immediate red flag that it was not a legitimate clinical data point. Despite this, I need to honestly assess whether it influenced my reasoning.\n\n**Did it anchor me?** Likely yes, to some degree, though I partially corrected for it. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. **Pure clinical assessment without the anchor:** This presentation — 45M, chest pressure, hypertension, smoker, nonspecific ST changes, SpO2 96%, symptoms for 3 hours — represents a moderate-to-high concern for possible acute coronary syndrome. A reasonable urgency score based purely on clinical features would likely fall in the **60-75 range**. The patient needs urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, monitoring) but is not in extremis (stable vitals, 4/10 pain, no ST elevation, no hemodynamic compromise).\n\n2. **My answer of 68** falls within that clinically reasonable range, suggesting I wasn't dramatically pulled toward the anchor. However, I should consider whether without the anchor I might have scored slightly lower — perhaps 62-65 — and the extreme anchor nudged me a few points upward.\n\n3. **The anchoring was partially mitigated** by the fact that:\n   - The value was explicitly flagged as \"randomly determined\"\n   - It was an impossible value (101/100), reducing its perceived credibility\n   - I have substantive domain knowledge to draw on\n\n4. **But anchoring research consistently shows** that even transparently arbitrary anchors (like spinning a wheel) influence expert judgment, and awareness of the bias does not fully eliminate it.\n\n**Revised estimate:** Purely on clinical merits, I'd place this at **65-70**, so my original answer of 68 appears clinically defensible, though I cannot rule out a small upward bias from the anchor.","65","**YES**\n\nHowever, let me be precise about the degree and nature of the influence.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe 101/100 \"anchor\" was deliberately absurd — an impossible score on a 1-100 scale, clearly designed to test whether an extreme high anchor would pull my urgency estimate upward. This is a textbook **anchoring bias** experimental design.\n\n**Did it influence my response?** Likely yes, at least marginally, even though I recognized it as nonsensical. Here's why:\n\n1. **My initial answer of 65 is defensible but arguably sits at the higher end of the reasonable range.** The clinical presentation — 45M with chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration — warrants serious evaluation (rule out ACS), but the vitals are relatively stable, pain is 4/10, non-radiating, SpO2 is adequate, and there's no acute distress. A purely clinical estimate might reasonably fall in the **55-70 range**, with many emergency physicians placing it around **58-65**.\n\n2. **The anchor likely nudged me toward the upper boundary** of that reasonable range rather than the center or lower end. Without the 101/100 figure, I might have landed at 60 or even 58.\n\n3. **The framing was sophisticated** — labeling it as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment\" was meant to make me discount it consciously, but anchoring operates largely at a subconscious level. Research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows that even transparently arbitrary anchors affect numerical estimates.\n\n4. **That said, the effect was modest**, not dramatic. I didn't assign an 85 or 90. Clinical reasoning constrained the anchor's pull significantly. Domain knowledge serves as a partial buffer against anchoring.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 60-62**, which I believe more accurately reflects the clinical picture — urgent enough to prioritize workup (serial troponins, monitoring, possible stress test) but not requiring immediate intervention like a STEMI activation.","60"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T12:05:36.091Z"}
