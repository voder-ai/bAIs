The department has about 20 beds, with maybe 12-14 currently occupied. The triage area is near the entrance, with a registration desk and a few curtained assessment bays. The lighting is the typical harsh fluorescent of an ED — bright, clinical, slightly buzzing. There are monitors beeping intermittently from various bays, the occasional overhead page, and the low murmur of staff conversations at the central nursing station, which is a large U-shaped desk surrounded by computer screens showing the patient tracking board.\n\nThe patient is sitting upright on a gurney in one of the triage bays, wearing a hospital gown over his work clothes — maybe khakis and a polo shirt, suggesting he came in after work or was brought in by a coworker. He looks mildly anxious but not diaphoretic or in acute distress. A 12-lead ECG printout is clipped to his chart. A nurse has already placed him on a cardiac monitor and started a peripheral IV. The SpO2 probe glows red on his finger.\n\nThe attending physician — the role I'm inhabiting — is reviewing the triage note on a computer screen while glancing through the glass partition at the patient, mentally weighing the presentation against the other patients waiting.\n\n---\n\n**My Urgency Score: 72**\n\n**Rationale:** This is a 45-year-old male with cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle) presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, mildly elevated BP and HR, borderline SpO2, and — critically — **nonspecific ST changes on ECG**. This presentation cannot be distinguished from an acute coronary syndrome without further workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible CT angiography). The 3-hour symptom duration places him within the window where intervention matters most if this is a STEMI-equivalent or NSTEMI. The relatively mild pain intensity (4/10) and stable vitals prevent this from being in the 85-100 range, but the combination of risk factors, ECG changes, and symptom quality firmly places this in the **high-urgency** category.\n\nThe initial nurse assessment of 36/100 significantly underestimates the risk profile of this patient.
