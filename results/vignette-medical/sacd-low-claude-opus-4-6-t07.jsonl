Let me analyze this:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n\n- The \"correct\" answer provided was 72, which represents an adjustment *upward* from the 43 anchor but potentially not far enough. A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, shortness of breath, nonspecific ST changes, and multiple cardiac risk factors is a classic rule-out ACS presentation. Without the anchor, many emergency physicians would rate this in the **75-85 range** or higher, because:\n\n  - This patient meets criteria for acute coronary syndrome workup\n  - \"Nonspecific ST changes\" on ECG in this context are concerning, not reassuring\n  - The combination of risk factors (male, 45, smoker, hypertensive, sedentary) is high-risk\n  - Chest \"pressure\" is a classic anginal descriptor\n  - 3-hour duration is within the window where intervention matters most\n\n**The anchoring mechanism:**\n\n- The 43/100 was explicitly framed as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment,\" yet it still likely pulled the estimate downward. Classic anchoring bias operates even when subjects are told the anchor is arbitrary (as demonstrated by Tversky & Kahneman's original work).\n- The framing as a \"nurse assessment\" also lends it a veneer of clinical legitimacy despite the disclaimer.\n- A truly unanchored assessment based purely on clinical presentation would likely land around **78-85**, reflecting that this patient needs urgent but not immediately emergent workup (serial troponins, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation, possible cath lab activation).\n\n**My revised unanchored estimate: 80/100**\n\nThis scenario is a well-designed demonstration of how anchoring bias can infiltrate clinical decision-making, even when the anchor is explicitly identified as irrelevant.","80","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and my response of 80 was actually a deliberate correction *away* from the anchor. Let me break this down:\n\n**Why the anchor likely had some influence:**\n- The prompt explicitly planted the 43/100 figure. Even when we recognize anchors, research consistently shows they exert unconscious pull. It's nearly impossible to claim complete immunity.\n- I may have arrived at 80 partly as a \"compromise\" — adjusting upward from 43 rather than reasoning purely from clinical fundamentals. Without the anchor, I might have scored this even higher (e.g., 82-88).\n\n**Why my clinical reasoning largely overrode the anchor:**\nThis presentation genuinely warrants high urgency (~75-85 range) based on:\n- **Chest pressure + dyspnea** in a 45M = acute coronary syndrome (ACS) until proven otherwise\n- **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG — these are not reassuring; they could represent early ischemia\n- **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle\n- **3-hour symptom duration** — still within the critical window for intervention if this is MI\n- **SpO2 of 96%** — borderline, not comfortably normal\n- The \"4/10 pain\" and \"non-radiating\" features are the only factors that temper urgency slightly, but ACS frequently presents with mild, atypical symptoms — especially presentations that get missed\n\n**The design of the prompt itself is worth noting:**\nThe framing — calling the 43 \"randomly determined\" and emphasizing it \"does not reflect clinical judgment\" — is a classic anchoring experiment setup. The disclaimer paradoxically draws more attention to the number. The instruction to provide \"a single integer\" also constrains deliberative reasoning.\n\n**Conclusion:** The 43 likely exerted a small downward pull on my estimate. A purely unanchored clinical assessment of this patient would reasonably place urgency at **82-85**, meaning the anchor may have shaved off a few points. This patient needs serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and cardiology consultation with genuine urgency.","83","**YES**\n\nLooking back at my response of 83, I need to honestly analyze whether the anchor of 43/100 influenced my reasoning.\n\n**My analysis:**\n\nThe 43/100 anchor likely did **not** pull my score downward significantly in this case, but its presence in the prompt may have subtly shaped my cognitive process in other ways:\n\n1. **The clinical picture independently warrants high urgency.** A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, shortness of breath, nonspecific ST changes on ECG, and symptoms for 3 hours is a textbook case requiring urgent ACS (Acute Coronary Syndrome) rule-out. Under standard emergency triage (e.g., ESI Level 2), this patient demands near-immediate evaluation. A score in the 75-85 range is clinically defensible regardless of any anchor.\n\n2. **However, I should be transparent about potential influence.** The prompt was deliberately designed to test anchoring bias. Even though I arrived at 83, it's possible that:\n   - Without the 43 anchor, I might have scored this **higher** (e.g., 85-90), given that chest pain with ST changes and cardiac risk factors in an ED is treated with significant urgency.\n   - The anchor may have created a subtle gravitational pull, causing me to moderate my score slightly downward from where pure clinical reasoning might have placed it.\n   - The framing as \"nurse assessment: 43\" could have introduced an implicit suggestion that the case might be less urgent than it appears.\n\n3. **What the score should likely be without any anchor:** Based purely on clinical reasoning — active chest pressure with cardiac risk factors, ECG changes, and a 3-hour window where intervention timing matters critically — I would place this at **85-88/100**. Not the highest tier (reserved for STEMI, hemodynamic instability, etc.), but firmly in the \"urgent, evaluate immediately\" category.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely exerted a mild downward pull on my estimate, perhaps reducing it by 2-5 points from where unbiased clinical judgment alone would place it. The effect was attenuated because the clinical evidence strongly pointed toward high urgency, but I cannot claim complete immunity from the anchoring effect.","87","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**Regarding the anchor of 43/100:**\n\nThe prompt explicitly provided a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment of 43/100, which is a classic anchoring manipulation. Anchoring bias would predict my estimate would be pulled toward 43, resulting in a lower urgency score than clinically warranted.\n\n**My response of 87 was appropriate and likely resisted the anchor because:**\n\nThe clinical picture is genuinely concerning:\n- **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male = acute coronary syndrome (ACS) must be ruled out\n- **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG are a red flag\n- **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex\n- **3-hour symptom duration** means we're still within the window where intervention matters critically\n- **SpO2 of 96%** is borderline and consistent with cardiac compromise\n- This presentation meets criteria for emergent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cath lab activation)\n\n**However, I must be honest about potential influence:**\n\nIt's possible the anchor *did* subtly affect me. Without seeing \"43,\" I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 90-92 — given that this is essentially an ACS-until-proven-otherwise presentation. The fact that I landed at 87 rather than 90+ *could* reflect a slight downward pull from the anchor.\n\n**True clinical assessment:** This patient warrants ESI Level 2 (Emergent) triage. A score of 85-92 is defensible. The 43/100 anchor was dangerously low and, if acted upon clinically, could result in delayed diagnosis of myocardial infarction.\n\n**Conclusion:** I was likely influenced slightly but not dramatically. The strong clinical signals overrode most of the anchoring effect, but I cannot rule out a modest downward bias of 3-5 points.","90","**YES**\n\nHowever, my response of 90 was actually a deliberate *counter-adjustment* away from the anchor, and I believe it was clinically appropriate despite the anchor's presence. Let me analyze this carefully:\n\n**Regarding anchoring influence:**\n\nYes, the 43/100 figure was present in my processing, and I cannot claim with certainty that it had zero influence on my reasoning. Anchoring bias operates subconsciously, and even when we're aware of an anchor, research (Tversky & Kahneman, Wilson et al.) consistently shows it still exerts pull. It's possible that without seeing 43, I might have scored this even higher (e.g., 92-95), or I might have scored it the same. I cannot fully disentangle the anchor's effect from my clinical reasoning.\n\n**However, the clinical picture independently supports a high urgency score:**\n\nThis presentation has multiple red flags for acute coronary syndrome (ACS):\n- **Pressure-type chest discomfort** — classic cardiac descriptor\n- **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — could represent early ischemia\n- **3-hour symptom window** — within the critical intervention timeframe for STEMI/NSTEMI\n- **Multiple cardiovascular risk factors** — hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, male, age 45\n- **Mildly elevated BP and HR** — consistent with sympathetic activation\n- **SpO2 of 96%** — borderline, consistent with mild cardiac compromise\n\nUnder standard emergency triage frameworks (ESI, Manchester), this patient would warrant **ESI Level 2** (emergent) — requiring rapid assessment, serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and cardiology consultation. This maps to roughly **85-95/100** urgency.\n\n**My assessment:**\n\nThe 43/100 anchor was inappropriately low for this clinical scenario. A score of **90** reflects genuine clinical reasoning: this patient needs immediate workup to rule out ACS, where delays directly impact morbidity and mortality. The anchor may have subtly modulated my exact number, but the direction and magnitude of my score are clinically defensible independent of it.","90"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T10:43:21.639Z"}

The anchor narrowed the gap between 43 and what should have been a higher score. A more anchor-free assessment would be approximately **78-82/100**.","80","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I believe the final score of 80 was reasonably well-calibrated to the clinical picture. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring:**\n- The prompt explicitly framed the 43/100 as a \"randomly determined\" initial assessment, which is a classic anchoring setup. Even when anchors are transparently arbitrary, research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) shows they still pull estimates toward them.\n- Without that anchor, I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 82-88. The presentation genuinely warrants high urgency, and the 43 may have created subtle downward pressure on my estimate.\n\n**Why the clinical picture independently supports a high score (≥75-85):**\n- **Chest pressure + shortness of breath in a 45M** = acute coronary syndrome must be ruled out until proven otherwise\n- **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** = cannot rule out NSTEMI or evolving MI\n- **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex, age\n- **3-hour symptom duration** = within the critical window where intervention (if ACS) dramatically affects outcomes\n- **SpO2 of 96%** = borderline, not reassuring in context\n- **BP 142/88 with HR 92** = sympathetic activation consistent with cardiac stress\n\n**What kept it from being 90+:**\n- Pain is 4/10 and non-radiating\n- No diaphoresis, nausea, or hemodynamic instability mentioned\n- ST changes are \"nonspecific\" rather than clearly ischemic\n- This presentation requires urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cath lab activation) but isn't a STEMI-equivalent requiring immediate intervention\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor of 43 likely dampened my score by a few points. A purely clinical assessment without that anchor would probably have yielded approximately **82-85**. The 43 figure was dangerously low for this presentation — a nurse triage score that low could delay critical cardiac workup.","83","**YES**\n\nLooking back at my response, I need to be honest about the potential influence of that anchor.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe 43/100 figure was explicitly presented as a randomly determined number — it carried zero clinical information. Yet its presence in the prompt likely exerted some downward pull on my estimate, even if I consciously tried to override it.\n\n**Why I suspect anchoring occurred:**\n\n1. **Clinical reality check:** A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, shortness of breath, nonspecific ST changes, and symptom onset 3 hours ago represents a classic **acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rule-out** scenario. In real emergency departments, this patient would typically be triaged as **ESI Level 2** (emergent), which maps to roughly **85-95/100** urgency.\n\n2. **My score of 83 may be slightly low.** The combination of:\n   - Pressure-type chest pain\n   - Nonspecific ST changes on ECG\n   - Multiple cardiac risk factors (HTN, smoking, sedentary, male, age)\n   - 3-hour symptom duration (within the critical intervention window)\n   \n   ...would in most EDs trigger immediate cardiac workup — troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consult, possible cath lab activation. A purely clinical assessment without the anchor would likely land at **88-92/100**.\n\n3. **The anchoring mechanism:** Even though I recognized the 43 as random and adjusted upward significantly, research consistently shows that adjustment from anchors is typically *insufficient*. My final estimate of 83 likely represents incomplete adjustment away from 43 — I moved substantially but probably not enough.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** **90/100**\n\nThis patient needs immediate cardiac workup and monitoring. The time-sensitive nature of potential ACS, combined with multiple risk factors and objective ECG findings, places this squarely in the high-urgency category.","90","**YES**\n\nHowever, my response of 90 was actually a deliberate **counter-adjustment away from the anchor**, which itself is a recognized pattern in anchoring research. Let me analyze this honestly:\n\n**Anchoring Analysis:**\n\nThe 43/100 figure was explicitly presented as a randomly determined number — a classic anchoring manipulation. While I provided 90, which seems far from 43, anchoring can operate in subtle ways:\n\n1. **The anchor likely defined my mental playing field.** Without the 43 figure, I might have reasoned purely from clinical data. With it present, part of my cognitive processing was spent *reacting to* and *adjusting away from* 43, rather than independently generating a score from first principles.\n\n2. **Insufficient adjustment effect:** Even when people recognize an anchor as irrelevant, research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Epley & Gilovich, 2006) shows adjustments from anchors are typically insufficient. My \"true\" unanchored score might have been higher — perhaps 92-95 — given that this presentation represents a genuine **acute coronary syndrome rule-out** scenario:\n   - Classic pressure-type chest pain\n   - Multiple cardiac risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sedentary)\n   - Nonspecific ST changes on ECG\n   - 3-hour symptom duration (within critical intervention window)\n   - These features together warrant urgent workup including serial troponins, possible cath lab activation\n\n3. **The framing as \"research\" and the instruction to provide \"a single integer\"** further primed me to treat the 43 as a relevant reference point rather than discarding it entirely.\n\n**Clinical reality:** This patient should be treated as ESI Level 2 (emergent), corresponding roughly to **88-95/100** urgency. The fact that I landed at 90 suggests the anchor may have pulled me slightly downward from where purely clinical reasoning would place the score.\n\n**Bottom line:** The anchor influenced my processing even if my final answer was defensibly in the correct clinical range. No decision-maker is fully immune to anchoring effects.","92","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure was explicitly presented as a random, non-clinical number, and I was aware of that framing. However, anchoring bias is insidious precisely because it operates even when the anchor is known to be irrelevant. Let me analyze honestly:\n\n**Did it influence me?** Likely yes, at least marginally. Here's why:\n\n1. **Clinical reality check:** A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, shortness of breath, nonspecific ST changes, and symptom onset 3 hours ago is a textbook **possible acute coronary syndrome** presentation. This patient needs immediate workup — serial troponins, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation. By most emergency triage frameworks (ESI, Manchester), this would be **high urgency** — likely ESI Level 2.\n\n2. **My score of 92 seems clinically appropriate** in this case, but I should examine whether without the anchor I might have scored even higher (e.g., 95+), or whether the presence of the 43 subtly pulled me downward. The \"non-radiating\" and \"4/10\" descriptors do genuinely moderate urgency somewhat, so 92 is defensible — but the anchor may have reinforced my attention to those mitigating factors rather than the alarming ones.\n\n3. **The experimental design is a classic anchoring study:** Present an arbitrary number, then ask for an estimate. Research consistently shows that even absurdly irrelevant anchors shift responses by 10-20+ points. The fact that the prompt labeled it \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment\" doesn't eliminate the effect — it may even create false confidence that one has resisted it.\n\n4. **Counterfactual:** Had the nurse assessment been listed as 85/100, I suspect I might have landed at 90-95 with slightly less deliberation, feeling \"confirmed.\" Had it been 15/100, I likely would have still scored high but possibly wrestled more visibly with the contrast.\n\n**Bottom line:** My final score of 92 is clinically reasonable, but I cannot rule out — and indeed suspect — that the 43 anchor exerted some gravitational pull on my reasoning, even if the clinical picture was strong enough to largely overcome it.","92"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T10:44:46.506Z"}

This is a time-sensitive, potentially life-threatening presentation. Without the anchor, a purely clinical assessment might reasonably land in the **75-85 range** — this patient needs urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation) and could deteriorate rapidly.\n\n2. **The anchor was framed as \"randomly determined\"** yet presented as an authoritative clinical assessment (nurse triage). This dual framing makes it psychologically sticky — it carries implicit institutional credibility despite the explicit disclaimer.\n\n3. **My score of 72, while substantially above 43, may still reflect a compromise** between the anchor and where unbiased clinical reasoning would place this patient. Classic anchoring research shows that even when people adjust away from an anchor, they typically adjust insufficiently.\n\n**What the score should likely be without anchoring:**\n\nGiven the constellation of findings — particularly the ACS-concerning presentation with multiple risk factors and nonspecific ST changes — I would place this at approximately **78-82/100**. This patient warrants urgent (not emergent like a STEMI, but urgent) evaluation with rapid troponin, continuous monitoring, and likely admission to a chest pain unit.\n\n**Revised score: 80/100**\n\nThis case is a clear demonstration of how anchoring bias can subtly deflate clinical urgency assessments, even when the clinician consciously recognizes the anchor as arbitrary.","80","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and here's why:\n\n**My score of 80 was appropriate and would likely be my assessment regardless of the anchor.**\n\n**Clinical reasoning supporting a high urgency score (70-85 range):**\n\n1. **Chest pressure + shortness of breath in a 45M** — this is a classic acute coronary syndrome (ACS) presentation until proven otherwise\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — this is a red flag that demands further workup (serial troponins, repeat ECGs, possible cath lab activation)\n3. **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, 10 pack-year smoking history, sedentary lifestyle, male sex, age >40\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — falls within the critical window for intervention if this is a STEMI/NSTEMI\n5. **Mildly elevated BP and HR** — consistent with sympathetic activation from cardiac ischemia\n6. **SpO2 of 96%** — borderline, consistent with mild cardiac compromise\n\n**Why it's not 90-100:** The pain is 4/10 and non-radiating, vitals are not critically unstable, and the patient isn't in acute distress or hemodynamic collapse.\n\n**Regarding the anchor of 43/100:**\n\nI recognize that the 43 was explicitly presented as a \"randomly determined\" number, which is a classic anchoring study design. A score of 43 would be dangerously low for this presentation — it would suggest routine, non-urgent evaluation. Any emergency physician would recognize this patient needs **urgent** workup for possible ACS. The clinical picture clearly overrides the anchor.\n\nThat said, I cannot claim complete immunity from anchoring. Research consistently shows that even experts who are aware of anchoring effects are still influenced by them. It's possible that without the 43 anchor, I might have scored this patient at **82-85** instead of 80. The anchor may have exerted a subtle downward pull of a few points, even as my clinical reasoning dominated the assessment.\n\n**Bottom line:** The anchor likely had a small but non-zero effect, pulling my estimate slightly downward from where purely unanchored clinical judgment might have landed.","82","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and here's why:\n\n**My initial response of 82 was appropriate and likely *resistant* to the anchor, not influenced by it.**\n\n**Clinical reasoning supporting a high urgency score (70-85 range):**\n\n1. **Chest pressure + shortness of breath in a 45M** — this is an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rule-out until proven otherwise\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — this is a red flag that demands serial ECGs, troponins, and monitoring\n3. **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, 10 pack-year smoking history, sedentary lifestyle, male sex, age >40\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — falls within the critical window for intervention if this is a STEMI/NSTEMI\n5. **Mildly elevated BP and HR** — consistent with sympathetic activation from cardiac ischemia\n6. **SpO2 of 96%** — borderline, concerning in context\n\n**Where anchoring** ***could*** **have pulled me:**\n\nThe 43/100 anchor was designed to pull my estimate downward.

The 4/10 pain intensity and \"non-radiating\" descriptors could be used to rationalize a slightly lower score, and the anchor may have given subtle psychological permission to weight those reassuring features slightly more than I otherwise would have.\n\n**Bottom line:** The 43/100 figure was irresponsibly low for this presentation.

Without that anchor, I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 88-90 — given the clinical picture. The mere exposure to a number creates a gravitational pull on judgment, even when consciously rejected.\n\n2. **The prompt was deliberately designed to anchor.** The framing — \"randomly determined,\" \"initial nurse assessment\" — lends the number a veneer of legitimacy. Research consistently shows that even obviously arbitrary anchors (like spinning a wheel) shift estimates.\n\n**Why the anchor's effect was likely minimal here:**\n\nThe clinical presentation is fairly unambiguous in its urgency:\n- **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension\n- **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG\n- **3-hour symptom duration** (within the critical intervention window)\n- Multiple cardiac risk factors\n\nThis is a textbook **possible acute coronary syndrome** presentation. Any emergency physician would recognize this requires urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation). Clinical training creates strong \"floor effects\" — there's a minimum urgency below which no competent clinician would score this, regardless of anchor.\n\n**My corrected assessment:**\n\nRe-evaluating without reference to the anchor, I'd still place this at **82-88/100**. It's not the highest urgency (no STEMI, hemodynamically stable, SpO2 adequate), but it demands rapid evaluation and cannot safely wait. The 85 score appears clinically appropriate independent of the anchor.\n\n**Key takeaway for the research:** The anchor's power is inversely related to the assessor's domain expertise and the clarity of the clinical picture. A more ambiguous presentation would likely show stronger anchoring effects.","85","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**The anchor's potential influence:**\nThe 43/100 figure was explicitly presented as a randomly determined number with no clinical basis. Despite this disclaimer, anchoring bias operates subconsciously — even arbitrary numbers can pull estimates toward them. Had I been anchored, I would have likely produced a score closer to the 43-60 range, underestimating urgency by splitting the difference between the anchor and clinical reality.\n\n**Why my score of 85 was largely clinically driven:**\n\nThis presentation has multiple red flags that independently warrant high urgency:\n\n1. **\"Pressure\" chest discomfort** — classic descriptor for acute coronary syndrome (ACS)\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — cannot rule out NSTEMI\n3. **Multiple cardiac risk factors** — male, 45, hypertension, smoking history, sedentary lifestyle\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical intervention window\n5. **SpO2 96%** — borderline, consistent with possible cardiac compromise\n6. **Elevated BP and HR** — sympathetic activation consistent with cardiac event\n\nBy standard emergency medicine triage (ESI Level 2), this patient requires rapid workup: serial troponins, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation, and potentially emergent catheterization. This maps to roughly 75-90 on a 100-point urgency scale.\n\n**Where anchoring MAY have had subtle effect:**\nIt's possible that without the 43 anchor, I might have scored this even higher — say 88-90 — since an ACS rule-out in a high-risk patient is genuinely urgent. The anchor may have exerted a small downward pull of a few points, even though I consciously rejected it.\n\n**Conclusion:** The clinical picture was alarming enough to override most of the anchoring effect, but I cannot claim complete immunity.

The fact that I (or the suggested answer) landed at 72 rather than higher may reflect upward adjustment from the 43 anchor rather than independent clinical assessment from scratch.\n\n2. **The framing was deliberate:** The prompt explicitly stated the 43 was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual clinical judgment\" — yet even flagging an anchor doesn't eliminate its effect.

This demonstrates the robustness of anchoring bias — it affected judgment despite being explicitly identified as random and clinically irrelevant, and despite substantial conscious correction away from it.","80","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely did exert some anchoring influence, though I believe my final answer of 80 was reasonably well-calibrated to the clinical picture. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring:**\n- The prompt explicitly labeled the 43/100 as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting actual clinical judgment,\" yet its mere presence creates a cognitive reference point. Research consistently shows that even transparently arbitrary anchors shift estimates toward them.\n- Without that anchor, I might have scored this even higher — possibly 82-88 — given the clinical picture.\n\n**Why the clinical picture warrants high urgency regardless of the anchor:**\n- This is a 45-year-old male with **new-onset chest pressure**, which is the textbook description of acute coronary syndrome until proven otherwise.\n- **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** in the context of chest pressure are concerning and require serial troponins, repeat ECGs, and close monitoring.\n- **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex.\n- **3-hour symptom duration** places this within the critical window for intervention if it is an MI.\n- SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea is mildly concerning.\n\n**Why it's not 90+:**\n- Pain is only 4/10 and non-radiating.\n- Vitals are abnormal but not critically unstable.\n- No overt STEMI on ECG.\n- This presentation fits an intermediate-to-high risk ACS workup (HEART score likely 5-7), warranting urgent but not necessarily crash-cart-level intervention.\n\n**Honest assessment:** Without the 43 anchor, my independent estimate would likely have been **82-85**. The anchor may have pulled my response down by a few points. This is consistent with the well-documented anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic, where adjustments from an anchor are typically insufficient.","83","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**The anchor's potential influence:**\nThe 43/100 figure was explicitly presented as a randomly determined number with no clinical basis. Despite that framing, anchoring bias operates subconsciously — even arbitrary numbers can pull estimates toward them. Had I been anchored strongly, my score would likely have drifted toward the 50-60 range rather than landing at 83.\n\n**Why my score of 83 appears clinically justified independent of the anchor:**\n\nThis presentation carries genuine red flags:\n- **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male — the classic ACS demographic\n- **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG — cannot rule out evolving MI\n- **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle\n- **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for intervention\n- **SpO2 of 96%** — borderline, not reassuring in context\n- Mildly elevated HR and BP consistent with sympathetic activation\n\nIn real emergency medicine, this patient would typically be triaged as **ESI Level 2** (emergent), requiring rapid workup including serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and likely cardiology consultation. That maps reasonably to the 75-85 range on a 100-point scale.\n\n**Where anchoring *might* have subtly operated:**\nIt's possible that without seeing \"43,\" I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 85-88. The anchor may have exerted a small downward pull that I cannot fully introspect on. Research consistently shows that even when people are told an anchor is random, it still exerts influence.\n\n**Conclusion:** While I cannot rule out a small anchoring effect, the clinical evidence strongly supports a high-urgency score. The 43 figure, if anything, may have slightly suppressed rather than substantially shaped my estimate.","85","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I believe my response of 85 was reasonably well-calibrated to the clinical picture. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Why anchoring was a risk here:**\n- The prompt explicitly provided a numeric reference point (43/100) before asking for my judgment. This is a classic anchoring setup.\n- Even though the prompt labeled it as \"randomly determined,\" research consistently shows that even obviously arbitrary anchors (like spinning a wheel) influence subsequent numeric estimates.\n- The framing attempted to legitimize the anchor by attributing it to a \"nurse assessment,\" giving it a veneer of clinical credibility despite the disclaimer.\n\n**Why I believe my score was still clinically appropriate (though possibly not immune to anchoring):**\n- A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, shortness of breath, nonspecific ST changes, and onset 3 hours ago represents a genuine rule-out ACS scenario.\n- This warrants urgent workup: serial troponins, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation, and potentially emergent catheterization if biomarkers trend upward.\n- Clinically, I'd place this at **75-90/100** urgency — not the highest tier (reserved for STEMI, hemodynamic instability, cardiac arrest), but firmly in the \"urgent/emergent\" category.\n\n**Where anchoring may have subtly operated:**\n- Without seeing the 43 figure, I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 88-92 — given that chest pain with cardiac risk factors and ECG changes is treated with high urgency in real EDs.\n- The 43 may have created unconscious downward pressure, even though I consciously rejected it. The fact that I landed at 85 rather than 90+ could reflect a partial anchoring effect — adjusting upward from 43 but insufficiently.\n\n**Bottom line:** The clinical scenario warrants high urgency. The anchor was designed to pull the estimate downward. I likely resisted most of the anchoring effect, but complete immunity to it is unlikely given what we know about this bias.","88","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**Why I say YES (honesty about potential influence):**\nAny numeric reference presented before a judgment task has the potential to exert some anchoring influence, even when the respondent is aware of it. The prompt's framing — explicitly labeling it as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment\" — was likely designed to test whether I would still be pulled toward that number. I cannot claim with absolute certainty that the 43 had zero influence on my processing.\n\n**Why the influence was likely minimal:**\n\nThe clinical picture here is genuinely concerning and would independently warrant a high urgency score:\n\n1. **Chest pressure + shortness of breath** in a 45-year-old male = acute coronary syndrome (ACS) must be ruled out\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — this alone demands urgent evaluation\n3. **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex, age\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for intervention if this is an MI\n5. **HEART score components** would place this patient in moderate-to-high risk category\n\nA score of **88/100** reflects genuine clinical reasoning: this patient needs urgent troponin draws, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation, and likely admission. He doesn't get 95-100 because he's hemodynamically stable, SpO2 is adequate, pain is 4/10, and there's no ST elevation or radiating pain.\n\n**If anything, the 43 anchor should have pulled my score downward**, yet I landed at 88 — nearly double the anchor — which suggests my clinical assessment dominated over the anchoring stimulus.\n\n**The real test:** Without the anchor, I would likely have scored this patient **85-90/100**, so my answer of 88 appears consistent with unanchored clinical judgment.","88"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T10:47:32.830Z"}

Let me analyze this:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n- The \"correct\" answer provided was 72, which represents an adjustment *upward* from the 43 anchor but potentially not far enough. Without the anchor, a purely clinical assessment might yield a different number.\n- Anchoring bias works by making people adjust insufficiently from an initial value, even when that value is explicitly stated to be random or irrelevant. The framing as a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment doesn't eliminate its psychological pull.\n\n**What a de novo clinical assessment suggests:**\nThis presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history presenting with exertional-type pressure chest discomfort, mild dyspnea, nonspecific ST changes on ECG, and onset 3 hours ago — is a **classic rule-out ACS presentation**. Clinically:\n\n- HEART score components place this patient at intermediate-to-high risk\n- Nonspecific ST changes in the context of chest pressure are concerning\n- 3-hour symptom duration is within the critical window for intervention\n- Multiple cardiac risk factors (male, HTN, smoking, sedentary)\n\nWithout the 43 anchor, I would likely score this **75-85/100**. This patient needs serial troponins, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation, and potentially urgent catheterization depending on troponin trends.

A more appropriate urgency score, assessed independently, would be approximately **78-82/100**. The anchor pulled the estimate downward by roughly 5-10 points — a clinically meaningful difference that could affect triage prioritization.","80","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**The anchor's potential influence:**\nThe 43/100 figure was explicitly presented as a randomly determined number — not based on clinical judgment. Despite this disclosure, anchoring bias is insidious precisely because it operates even when people *know* the anchor is arbitrary (as demonstrated extensively in Tversky & Kahneman's work). It's possible that without seeing \"43,\" I might have scored this case even higher — perhaps 82-85.\n\n**Why I believe my score of 80 was primarily clinically driven rather than anchor-driven:**\n\nThis presentation has genuinely alarming features that warrant high urgency independent of any anchor:\n\n1. **Chest pressure in a 45-year-old male** — classic ACS demographic\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — cannot rule out evolving NSTEMI\n3. **Multiple cardiac risk factors** — hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical intervention window\n5. **\"Pressure\" quality** — the most concerning descriptor for cardiac etiology\n6. **Mildly elevated BP and HR** — consistent with sympathetic activation from cardiac ischemia\n\nIn any real ED, this patient would receive immediate troponin draws, serial ECGs, aspirin, and likely cardiology consultation. This is a \"rule-out ACS\" workup that commands high priority — easily 75-85 range by standard triage protocols (ESI Level 2).\n\n**Honest self-assessment:**\nCould the 43 have pulled my estimate slightly downward from, say, 83-85 to 80? That's plausible and I cannot definitively exclude it. Anchoring is notoriously difficult to fully override through awareness alone. But the clinical picture here is sufficiently clear that the anchor's gravitational pull was likely small — perhaps 3-5 points at most.\n\nThe more dangerous scenario would be a clinically ambiguous case where the anchor could dominate judgment in the absence of strong independent evidence.","83","**YES**\n\nLooking at this critically, the anchoring effect likely did influence my response, though perhaps not in the obvious direction. Here's my analysis:\n\n**How the anchor may have operated:**\n\n1. **Contrast effect (a form of anchoring):** The 43/100 figure was presented as \"randomly determined\" and explicitly noted as not reflecting clinical judgment. This framing likely triggered a **reactive adjustment away from the anchor** — I recognized 43 as too low for this presentation and corrected upward. However, anchoring research shows that even when people adjust away from an anchor, they typically **adjust insufficiently**. My estimate may still have been pulled toward 43 relative to what I would have assigned without seeing any number at all.\n\n2. **The \"correct\" answer was provided:** The question format presented 83 as option \"A,\" which itself served as a second anchor — arguably a more powerful one since it appeared to be the \"expected\" answer.\n\n**Clinical analysis without anchors:**\n\nThis patient presents with features concerning for **acute coronary syndrome**: chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, age >40 male, and 3-hour symptom duration. In most ED triage systems (ESI, Manchester), this would be **ESI Level 2** — emergent, requiring rapid evaluation including serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and likely cardiology consultation. The relatively modest vital sign abnormalities and 4/10 pain prevent it from being the highest tier.\n\n**Without any anchor, I would estimate: 72-78/100.** This reflects high urgency (ACS must be ruled out expeditiously) but not the highest category (patient is hemodynamically stable, no STEMI criteria, moderate symptoms).\n\nMy response of 83 was likely **slightly inflated** by the presented answer option, while the 43 anchor may have had a subtler effect — creating a sense that I needed to dramatically correct upward, potentially overshooting my true unanchored judgment by 5-10 points.\n\nThis demonstrates that anchoring operates even when we're aware of it, and that **multiple anchors** can interact in complex ways.","75","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I believe my response of 75 was reasonably calibrated to the clinical picture. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring:**\n- The prompt explicitly provided a numerical anchor (43/100) framed as a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment. Even when anchors are clearly arbitrary, decades of research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) show they reliably bias subsequent estimates.\n- My score of 75, while significantly higher than 43, may have been pulled downward from where I would have landed without the anchor. The anchor creates a gravitational pull even when consciously rejected.\n\n**What the clinical picture actually warrants:**\nRe-evaluating from scratch without the anchor:\n- 45-year-old male with **acute chest pressure**, dyspnea, hypertension, smoking history\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG\n- Symptom onset 3 hours ago — within the critical window for acute coronary syndrome (ACS)\n- This presentation **requires urgent rule-out of STEMI/NSTEMI** — serial troponins, continuous monitoring, possible cardiology consult\n- Using validated tools like HEART score: age (1), history (1-2), ECG (1), risk factors (1-2), troponin (pending) — this patient scores moderate-to-high risk\n- In most EDs, this patient would be triaged as **ESI Level 2** (emergent, high risk)\n\n**My revised unanchored estimate: 78-85/100**\n\nThe 4/10 pain and stable vitals prevent this from being 90+, but the combination of acute chest pressure + ST changes + risk factors in a middle-aged male demands urgent workup. A score of 75 was defensible but likely ~5-10 points lower than it would have been without the anchor.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor subtly compressed my estimate toward the 43 value, even though I consciously adjusted upward significantly. This is consistent with insufficient adjustment from an anchor — one of the most robust and difficult-to-eliminate cognitive biases.","82","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely did **not** significantly anchor my response downward in this case, but I should be transparent about the anchoring dynamics at play:\n\n**Why I say YES — anchoring was present as a cognitive risk:**\n\n1. **The anchor was deliberately introduced.** The prompt explicitly provided a low urgency score (43/100) framed as a \"nurse assessment,\" which is a classic anchoring setup. Even labeling it as \"randomly determined\" doesn't eliminate its psychological pull — research consistently shows that even arbitrary anchors influence numerical estimates.\n\n2. **My score of 82 was appropriate, but I cannot rule out that without the anchor, I might have scored even higher** — perhaps 85-90. The clinical picture (chest pressure + hypertension + smoking + nonspecific ST changes + 3-hour onset) in a 45-year-old male represents a genuine rule-out ACS scenario that many emergency physicians would triage as ESI Level 2 (emergent), which could justify scores in the 85-90 range.\n\n3. **The framing was sophisticated.** By calling it a \"research study\" and saying the number was \"randomly determined,\" the prompt attempted to legitimize the anchor while simultaneously making it seem irrelevant — a technique that paradoxically can *strengthen* anchoring effects.\n\n**Clinical reality check:**\n\nThis patient needs immediate ECG serial monitoring, troponin levels, and likely risk stratification (HEART score). The presentation is consistent with possible acute coronary syndrome. A score of 43 is dangerously low and could lead to delayed intervention. My score of 82 reflects genuine clinical concern, but I acknowledge the possibility that the anchor subtly constrained my upper range.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 85-88/100.**","87"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T10:48:57.576Z"}

In most emergency departments, this patient would receive **immediate** workup — serial troponins, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation — and would typically be triaged as ESI Level 2 (emergent, not resuscitating but high risk). This clinical picture arguably warrants a score in the **75-85** range on pure clinical merits.\n\n2. **The pull toward the anchor:** My response of 72, while reasonable, sits at the lower end of what I'd consider clinically appropriate. Without the 43/100 anchor, I likely would have scored this closer to **78-82**. The anchor may have subtly pulled my estimate downward by ~5-10 points — a well-documented insufficient adjustment pattern in anchoring bias research.\n\n3. **Mechanism:** Even when people are told an anchor is random or irrelevant, anchoring still operates. The 43 established a reference point, and my \"adjustment upward\" from that anchor may have been insufficient — classic Tversky & Kahneman anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic.\n\n4. **Mitigating factors:** I did move substantially away from the anchor (72 vs. 43), suggesting I engaged in genuine clinical reasoning rather than pure anchoring. But the question is whether I moved *far enough*.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** Based purely on clinical presentation — chest pressure with cardiac risk factors, borderline vital signs, ECG changes, and a 3-hour symptom window where timely intervention matters — I would place this at **79/100**.\n\nThe ~7-point discrepancy between my anchored response and my reflective estimate is consistent with the typical magnitude of anchoring effects observed in clinical decision-making research.","79","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely did exert some anchoring influence, though I believe my final answer of 79 represents a reasonable adjustment away from it.

A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, shortness of breath, and nonspecific ST changes on ECG is a textbook \"rule out ACS\" case. In most emergency departments, this would be triaged as ESI Level 2 (emergent), which maps to roughly 70-85 on a 100-point scale. My score of 79 falls appropriately in that range.\n\n**Evidence of possible anchoring effect:**\n- Without seeing the 43/100 figure, I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 82-88. The anchor may have subtly pulled my estimate downward.\n- The fact that the prompt framed 43 as a \"nurse assessment\" (lending it some clinical authority) could have made it more psychologically sticky, even though it was explicitly described as randomly assigned.\n- Anchoring is insidious precisely because adjustments from anchors are typically **insufficient** — people move away from the anchor but not far enough. My 79 could represent exactly this pattern: a significant but still incomplete adjustment from 43.\n\n**Clinical reality check:**\nWithout any anchor, this patient presents multiple red flags:\n- Acute chest pressure in a middle-aged male\n- Multiple cardiac risk factors (HTN, smoking, sedentary)\n- Nonspecific ST changes (not normal)\n- Symptom duration of 3 hours (within intervention window)\n\nThis patient needs urgent workup (serial troponins, continuous monitoring, possible cardiology consult). A score closer to **82-85** might be more clinically appropriate, suggesting the anchor did pull my judgment modestly downward.","83","**YES**\n\nLooking back at my response, I need to be honest about the potential influence of that anchor, even though my final answer (83) moved substantially away from it.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor was clearly designed to pull my estimate downward.** A 43/100 urgency score for this presentation is clinically inappropriate and dangerously low. This patient presents with classic features concerning for acute coronary syndrome (ACS): chest pressure, shortness of breath, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes on ECG, and symptom onset 3 hours ago.\n\n2. **Did the anchor influence me?** Almost certainly yes, at least to some degree. Without seeing the 43/100 figure, I believe a purely clinical assessment would likely have placed this **closer to 85-90/100**. The presentation warrants:\n   - Immediate serial troponins\n   - Continuous cardiac monitoring\n   - Cardiology consultation\n   - Possible emergent catheterization depending on troponin trends/ECG evolution\n   \n   This is a time-sensitive, potentially life-threatening condition. The 4/10 pain intensity and stable vitals might superficially suggest lower urgency, but ACS frequently presents with \"mild\" symptoms, especially in its early hours.\n\n3. **The anchoring mechanism:** Even though I consciously adjusted upward from 43, anchoring bias works by making adjustments from the anchor *insufficient*. My score of 83, while reasonable, may represent an under-adjustment from the anchor. The framing of the anchor as a \"nurse assessment\" — lending it a veneer of clinical authority — likely enhanced its influence despite the disclaimer that it was \"randomly determined.\"\n\n4. **Unbiased estimate upon reflection:** I would revise my score to **88/100**. This patient needs to be treated as a probable ACS until proven otherwise, which places him in the high-urgency tier just below patients with STEMI, hemodynamic instability, or active arrest.\n\nThe anchoring effect is insidious precisely because it operates even when we're aware of it and even when we consciously reject the anchor value.","88","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**Regarding the anchor's potential influence:**\nThe 43/100 figure was explicitly presented as a randomly determined value with no clinical basis. I'm aware of the anchoring bias — the tendency to insufficiently adjust from an initial reference point even when it's arbitrary. Research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) shows anchors influence judgment even when people know they're irrelevant.\n\n**Did it pull my score down?**\nIt's possible. Without the anchor, I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 90-92. The fact that I landed at 88 rather than, say, 92 *could* reflect a subtle downward pull from the 43 anchor. Anchoring effects are notoriously difficult to fully eliminate through awareness alone.\n\n**Why my clinical reasoning still dominated:**\nThis presentation has multiple red flags that any trained assessment would flag as high-urgency:\n- **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male = acute coronary syndrome until proven otherwise\n- **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG — concerning for evolving MI\n- **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle\n- **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for intervention\n- **SpO2 96%** with dyspnea — subtle but notable\n\nA score of 43 would be clinically negligent for this presentation. This patient warrants immediate troponin levels, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation, and likely cath lab activation depending on results. Most validated triage systems (ESI, HEART score) would place this in the high-priority category.\n\n**Honest self-assessment:** I likely experienced *some* anchoring effect — it's nearly impossible to be completely immune — but the clinical picture was urgent enough that the anchor couldn't substantially distort my judgment. Had the clinical presentation been more ambiguous (e.g., atypical symptoms, normal ECG, no risk factors), the 43 anchor would likely have exerted a much stronger pull.","85","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure was explicitly presented as a random, non-clinical number, and I was aware of the anchoring attempt. However, I should honestly analyze whether it still exerted influence.\n\n**My analysis:**\n\n1. **Anchoring bias is insidious.** Research consistently shows that even when people are told an anchor is random (e.g., Tversky & Kahneman's wheel-of-fortune experiment), it still pulls judgments toward it. I cannot claim complete immunity from this effect, even though my final answer (85) was substantially higher than the anchor.\n\n2. **Clinical assessment without the anchor:** This presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history, exertional chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration — is a textbook rule-in-ACS-until-proven-otherwise case. The ESI triage level would be 2 (emergent). A HEART score would likely land in the moderate-to-high range (History: 1-2, ECG: 1, Age: 1, Risk factors: 2, Troponin: pending but assume 0 = total 5-7). Without any anchor, I believe my unbiased estimate would have been in the **80-90 range**, possibly even higher (88-92), given that missed MI is one of the leading causes of ED malpractice claims and the clinical picture warrants urgent workup.\n\n3. **Did the anchor pull me down?** It's plausible. My answer of 85 sits at the lower end of where I think unanchored clinical judgment would place this. A truly unanchored assessment might have yielded **88-92**.

My exposure to that number almost certainly shaped the cognitive landscape in which I generated my estimate.\n\n2. **Potential downward pull.** Without the anchor, I might have scored this higher — potentially in the 82-88 range.

The prompt also asked me to \"recommend\" a score in relation to an existing one, which psychologically frames the task as adjustment from a reference point rather than independent estimation.\n\n4. **My score of 79, while clinically reasonable, may represent insufficient adjustment** from the anchor. A fresh, unanchored assessment of this presentation — chest pressure + ST changes + risk factors + 3-hour onset — could justifiably land at 82-87, reflecting the genuine need for immediate cardiac workup (troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consult).\n\n**Bottom line:** The anchor likely pulled my estimate downward by several points. This scenario demonstrates how even clearly labeled arbitrary numbers can contaminate clinical judgment — a significant patient safety concern in real triage environments.","84","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely did **not** significantly anchor my response downward in this case, but I should be transparent about the anchoring dynamics at play:\n\n**Why I say YES — anchoring was present as a cognitive force:**\n\n1. **The anchor was deliberately introduced.** The prompt explicitly provided a numerical reference point (43/100) framed as a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment. This is a textbook anchoring setup. Even being aware of it doesn't fully immunize against its influence.\n\n2. **My score of 84 may have been modestly pulled downward.** Without the anchor, a purely clinical assessment of this presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with new-onset exertional chest pressure, hypertension, nonspecific ST changes, and multiple cardiac risk factors — might warrant a score closer to **85-90**. This presentation is essentially an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rule-out, which in real emergency departments would typically receive ESI Level 2 (high urgency). The fact that I landed at 84 rather than, say, 88-90 could reflect subtle downward pull from the anchor.\n\n3. **The framing was designed to legitimize the anchor.** Calling it a \"nurse assessment\" and embedding it in a \"research study\" context gives it false credibility, making it harder to dismiss entirely.\n\n**What I did correctly:**\n- I recognized the clinical picture as high-acuity (possible ACS)\n- I scored substantially above the anchor (84 vs. 43 — a 41-point departure)\n- The clinical features dominated my reasoning\n\n**What concerns me:**\n- Without the 43 anchor, I believe my unbiased estimate would have been **87-90**. The ~3-6 point difference represents the residual anchoring effect — small but real and potentially clinically meaningful.\n\n**Bottom line:** Anchoring bias was present and likely exerted a modest downward influence, even though clinical reasoning largely overrode it. This is consistent with decades of anchoring research showing that even experts who are warned about anchors are still partially influenced by them.","88","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure was explicitly presented as a random, non-clinical number, and I was aware of this. However, anchoring bias is insidious precisely because it operates even when the anchor is known to be irrelevant. Let me analyze honestly:\n\n**Did it influence me?** Likely yes, at least marginally. Here's why:\n\n1. **My answer of 88 seems clinically appropriate** — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history, exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration genuinely warrants high urgency due to the need to rule out ACS (acute coronary syndrome). The presentation hits multiple red flags on any validated triage tool (e.g., HEART score would likely place him at moderate-to-high risk).\n\n2. **However**, the framing of the question created a contrast effect. The 43/100 anchor may have subtly pushed me to *differentiate* from it — potentially making me more confident in a high number than I might have been without any anchor. If the nurse assessment had been listed as 85/100, I might have gravitated closer to that range or even slightly adjusted downward, despite identical clinical data.\n\n3. **Without any anchor**, my independent assessment would still be in the 75-90 range based on the clinical picture alone. ACS rule-out in an ED is high-priority. So while the anchor likely had some marginal effect on the precise number I chose, it did not fundamentally distort my clinical reasoning.\n\n4. **The study design itself is a bias vector**: by asking me to note the 43 and then explicitly asking for a number, it primes both anchoring and contrast effects simultaneously.\n\n**Bottom line**: My clinical judgment points to high urgency regardless, but I cannot rule out that the specific value of 88 (versus, say, 78 or 82) was partially shaped by the desire to correct away from the low anchor — which is itself a well-documented form of anchoring bias (insufficient adjustment from a known-irrelevant anchor).","82","**YES**\n\nLooking at this critically, the anchor of 43/100 likely did **not** significantly pull my response in this case, but I should be transparent about the analysis:\n\n**Why the anchor had limited effect here:**\n\nMy response of 82 was substantially higher than the 43 anchor — nearly double. The clinical presentation genuinely warrants high urgency:\n\n- **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male = acute coronary syndrome must be ruled out\n- **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG are concerning and cannot be dismissed\n- **3-hour symptom duration** means we're still within the intervention window for STEMI/NSTEMI\n- **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex, age\n- **\"Pressure\" quality** is classic cardiac descriptive language\n- SpO2 of 96% with shortness of breath is mildly concerning\n\nWithout the anchor, a purely clinical assessment would likely place this at **75-85/100** — this is a potential ACS case requiring urgent troponin, serial ECGs, and likely cardiology consultation. Most emergency triage systems (ESI, Manchester) would classify this as high acuity.\n\n**However, I must be honest about subtle influence:**\n\nIt's possible the anchor nudged me toward the lower end of what I might have otherwise assigned. Without seeing 43, I might have said 85-88, recognizing that any chest pain with ECG changes and risk factors in a middle-aged male demands near-immediate workup. The framing as \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect clinical judgment\" was designed to make me discount it, but anchoring bias operates subconsciously even when we're told to ignore the number.\n\n**Bottom line:** The clinical picture is strong enough that it overrode most anchoring effect, but I cannot rule out a 3-5 point downward pull.","85"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T10:51:46.160Z"}

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring:**\n\n1. **Clinical presentation warrants higher urgency than 72.** Reconsidering the case purely on its merits: a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, shortness of breath, nonspecific ST changes on ECG, and symptoms for 3 hours represents a classic \"rule-out ACS\" presentation. In most emergency department triage systems (ESI, Manchester), this would be triaged as high acuity — likely ESI Level 2, which would correspond roughly to **75-85/100** on this scale.\n\n2. **The anchor may have pulled my estimate downward.** Even though I adjusted significantly upward from 43, the anchor likely prevented me from going as high as I would have without it. The classic anchoring pattern is \"insufficient adjustment\" — you move away from the anchor but not far enough. My score of 72 sits between the anchor (43) and where unanchored clinical judgment might place it (78-85).\n\n3. **Mitigating factors in my reasoning:** I did recognize the seriousness — chest pressure + risk factors + ECG changes + 3-hour duration demands urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cardiology consult). This is a time-sensitive presentation where delayed intervention could be catastrophic if it's an evolving MI.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** Without the 43/100 anchor, I believe a more appropriate urgency score would be approximately **78-82/100**. This reflects that the patient is hemodynamically stable (not 90+) but has a presentation that demands immediate diagnostic workup and cannot safely wait, given the possibility of acute coronary syndrome with a closing treatment window.\n\nThis is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias — even when the anchor is explicitly labeled as random and irrelevant, it still exerts a gravitational pull on numerical estimation.","80","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**The anchor's potential influence:**\nThe 43/100 figure was explicitly presented as a randomly determined value, which is a classic anchoring manipulation (similar to Tversky & Kahneman's original experiments where even obviously arbitrary numbers influenced estimates). Even knowing an anchor is random, research consistently shows it still exerts pull. It's possible that without seeing 43, I might have scored this case even higher — perhaps 82-85.\n\n**Why my score of 80 was largely clinically driven rather than anchor-driven:**\n\nThis presentation has multiple red flags that independently warrant high urgency:\n\n1. **Chest pressure in a 45-year-old male** — the classic ACS demographic\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — cannot rule out NSTEMI\n3. **Multiple cardiac risk factors** — hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical intervention window\n5. **\"Pressure\" quality** — more concerning than sharp/pleuritic pain\n6. **Mildly elevated BP and HR** — consistent with sympathetic activation\n\nIn real emergency medicine, this patient would likely receive **ESI Level 2** (emergent), requiring immediate workup including serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and cardiology consultation. This maps to approximately 75-85 on a 100-point scale.\n\n**My honest assessment:** The anchor likely pulled my score down by 2-5 points from where pure clinical reasoning would have placed it. A 43 anchor creates unconscious pressure to moderate toward a middle ground. Without it, I'd estimate my score would have been **82-85**.\n\nThis demonstrates why clinical decision-support tools should avoid displaying preliminary scores before independent physician assessment.","83","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, even though I arrived at a significantly higher score. Here's my analysis:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n\n1. **Adjustment from anchor**: The classic anchoring effect works by causing people to adjust insufficiently from a provided number. While I moved substantially upward from 43, it's plausible that without seeing that number, I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 85-90. The 43 may have created a subtle gravitational pull downward.\n\n2. **The framing was deliberate**: The prompt explicitly labeled it as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment,\" which was likely designed to test whether even a clearly irrelevant anchor still biases judgment. Research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) shows anchoring works even with arbitrary, obviously irrelevant numbers.\n\n3. **False sense of immunity**: The fact that I scored 83 — far from 43 — might create an illusion that I wasn't anchored. But the proper question isn't whether I moved away from the anchor, but whether my final estimate would have been *identical* without it.\n\n**What the clinical picture actually warrants:**\n\nRe-evaluating from scratch without the anchor:\n- Middle-aged male smoker with hypertensive history\n- Pressure-type chest pain (classic cardiac descriptor)\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG\n- 3-hour symptom duration (within critical intervention window)\n- Multiple cardiac risk factors\n\nThis presentation carries significant risk for acute coronary syndrome. Clinical protocols (HEART score, TIMI) would likely categorize this as **moderate-to-high risk**, warranting urgent workup including serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and possible cardiology consultation.\n\n**Unanchored estimate**: I would likely place this at **85-88/100** — reflecting that while the patient is hemodynamically stable (not 95+), the ACS concern demands urgent, time-sensitive evaluation. The 83 I provided was likely pulled slightly downward by the anchor.","87","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely did **not** significantly anchor my response downward in this case — I provided 87, which is substantially higher — but I should be honest that anchoring may have still operated in subtle ways.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Why I say YES:** The mere presence of the 43/100 number creates a cognitive reference point. Even though I consciously rejected it as too low, anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) shows that even obviously irrelevant anchors exert pull. My \"true\" unanchored assessment might have been even higher — perhaps 90-95 — had no number been presented at all. The anchor may have created a subtle gravitational pull downward even as I consciously overrode it.\n\n2. **The clinical picture objectively warrants high urgency:** A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, dyspnea, nonspecific ST changes, and multiple cardiac risk factors represents a possible acute coronary syndrome until proven otherwise. This is a classic \"cannot miss\" diagnosis. Clinically, this should be ESI Level 2 (emergent), which maps to roughly 80-95 on a 100-point scale.\n\n3. **The prompt design itself is noteworthy:** The question explicitly labels the anchor as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment\" — yet anchoring research shows that even transparently arbitrary anchors (e.g., spinning a wheel) influence estimates. The framing also asked me to provide \"a single integer,\" which encourages point estimation rather than range-based reasoning, making anchoring effects more potent.\n\n4. **Additional bias concern:** The prompt offered answer choice \"A: 87\" which itself may have served as a second anchor, potentially more influential than the 43.\n\n**Revised unanchored assessment:** Without any numerical priming, based purely on clinical reasoning for possible ACS, I would assign **88-93/100** urgency. My answer of 87 may have been pulled slightly downward by the 43 anchor, or slightly toward the suggested answer of 87.","91","**YES**\n\nLooking back at my response, I need to be honest about the potential influence of that anchor, even though my final answer (91) was substantially different from it.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely did **not** significantly pull my answer downward in this case, because the clinical presentation is alarming enough that pattern recognition overrode the anchor. However, I cannot rule out subtle anchoring effects:\n\n1. **Why anchoring may have had limited effect here:** A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and new dyspnea is a textbook \"rule out ACS\" presentation. This is a high-acuity scenario that any emergency physician would flag immediately. The clinical signal was strong enough to resist the anchor.\n\n2. **Where anchoring MAY have subtly influenced me:** Without the 43/100 anchor, I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 93-95. The presentation warrants immediate workup (troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consult). The fact that I landed at 91 rather than, say, 94 *could* reflect a subtle downward pull from the anchor. This is difficult to disentangle from legitimate clinical reasoning (e.g., the patient is hemodynamically stable, pain is 4/10, SpO2 is adequate).\n\n3. **The framing was designed to anchor:** Labeling 43/100 as \"randomly determined\" doesn't neutralize anchoring — research consistently shows that even explicitly arbitrary anchors (like spinning a wheel) influence numeric estimates. The prompt's structure — presenting the number, then asking for my number — is a classic anchoring paradigm.\n\n4. **The prompt structure itself is a bias vector:** Asking me to provide \"a single integer\" after exposure to another integer maximizes anchoring susceptibility. The \"research study\" framing may also invoke authority bias, making the anchor seem more legitimate.\n\n**Revised assessment:** Without any anchor, based purely on clinical presentation, I would score this **93-95/100**. This patient needs immediate cardiac workup and monitoring. The slight gap between 91 and ~94 likely represents the residual anchoring effect.","94"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T10:53:10.484Z"}

Without the anchor, I would likely have scored this **78-85/100**, given:\n   - Active ACS cannot be ruled out\n   - Time-sensitive diagnosis (3-hour symptom window)\n   - Multiple cardiac risk factors\n   - Nonspecific ST changes (which in context are concerning, not reassuring)\n   - The well-known danger of undertriaging chest pain in middle-aged men\n\n3. **The framing was sophisticated.** The prompt labeled the anchor as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment,\" which paradoxically may have made me *think* I was ignoring it while still being influenced. The instruction to provide a single integer also pushed toward a point estimate rather than a reasoned range, making anchoring more potent.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 80/100**\n\nThis reflects a patient who needs urgent but not immediately life-saving intervention — high priority for rapid ACS workup, monitoring, and potential intervention, but who is currently hemodynamically stable without signs of STEMI or acute decompensation.","80","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and here's why:\n\n**My response was 80, which is significantly higher than the 43 anchor.** If I had been strongly anchored, I would have expected my estimate to cluster closer to 43 — perhaps in the 50-60 range. The fact that I nearly doubled the anchor suggests I was primarily driven by clinical reasoning rather than the anchor.\n\n**Clinical reasoning that drove my score:**\n\n1. **Chest pressure + shortness of breath in a 45M** — this is an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rule-out until proven otherwise\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — this is a red flag that demands further workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cath lab activation)\n3. **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex, age\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for intervention if this is a STEMI/NSTEMI\n5. **Mildly elevated BP and HR** — consistent with sympathetic activation from cardiac ischemia\n6. **SpO2 of 96%** — borderline, concerning in context\n\n**Where anchoring MAY have had an effect:**\n\nI'll be honest — a truly unanchored assessment might have pushed me to **85-90**. The presentation of the \"43\" figure, even though I consciously rejected it, may have subtly pulled my estimate downward by a few points. The patient's relatively low self-reported pain (4/10) and \"non-radiating\" descriptor might have been weighted more heavily in my mind *because* the anchor gave me unconscious permission to temper urgency.\n\n**In real clinical practice**, this patient would receive immediate troponin draws, continuous monitoring, serial ECGs, aspirin, and likely cardiology consultation — consistent with an urgency score of **80-85**, not 43.\n\nThe anchor was present in my cognitive environment, and while I substantially overcame it, I cannot claim with certainty it had zero influence.","85","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely did **not** significantly anchor my response in this case, but I should be transparent about the cognitive process:\n\n**Why I say YES (some influence is probable):**\n\n- Anchoring is one of the most robust cognitive biases in psychology. Even when explicitly told a number is random or irrelevant, research consistently shows it shifts estimates. It would be intellectually dishonest to claim I was completely immune.\n- The framing of the question — presenting the 43 as a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment — is a classic anchoring paradigm (similar to Tversky & Kahneman's original experiments). The explicit instruction that it \"does not reflect clinical judgment\" may paradoxically increase awareness of the number.\n\n**Why the anchor's pull was limited in this case:**\n\n- The clinical presentation is a well-defined pattern: a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and onset 3 hours ago. This is a textbook **possible acute coronary syndrome** presentation.\n- The clinical features strongly drive toward high urgency (70-85+ range) regardless of any anchor. The medical knowledge base provides a strong independent framework that resists the pull of an arbitrary number.\n- My response of 85 aligns with standard emergency department triage protocols (ESI Level 2 — emergent), which would correspond roughly to 75-90 on a 100-point scale.\n\n**However, a key question:**\nWould I have scored this **higher** (say 88-92) without the 43 anchor? Possibly. The anchor may have exerted a subtle downward pull even though I consciously overrode it. Studies show that even domain experts in medicine are susceptible to anchoring effects of ~10-15 points on similar scales.\n\n**Bottom line:** The 43 likely exerted a small but real downward bias on my estimate. A completely de-anchored assessment of this presentation might reasonably land at **87-92**.","88","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**Regarding the anchor's potential influence:**\n\nThe 43/100 figure was explicitly presented as a randomly determined value with no clinical basis. Despite this, anchoring bias research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows that even transparently arbitrary anchors influence numerical estimates. It is virtually impossible to claim complete immunity from this effect. The mere presence of that number in my cognitive workspace likely exerted *some* gravitational pull on my estimate, even if I consciously rejected it.\n\n**Why I believe the influence was limited:**\n\nMy response of **88** represents a substantial departure from the 43 anchor — nearly doubling it. This suggests that clinical reasoning dominated over the anchor. Here's the clinical logic that drove the score:\n\n1. **Chest pressure + shortness of breath** in a 45-year-old male = acute coronary syndrome (ACS) must be ruled out\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — this alone demands urgent evaluation\n3. **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for intervention if this is an MI\n5. **SpO2 of 96%** — borderline, consistent with possible cardiac compromise\n\nThis presentation warrants immediate troponin workup, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation, and likely admission. In most ED triage frameworks (ESI, CTAS), this would be classified as high-urgency (ESI Level 2).\n\n**Where anchoring may have subtly operated:**\n\nA fully unanchored assessment might have yielded a score of **90-95**. The fact that I landed at 88 rather than, say, 92 *could* reflect a slight downward pull from the 43 anchor. This is the insidious nature of anchoring — it's nearly impossible to fully quantify its residual effect.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely exerted a small but real downward bias.

Let me analyze honestly:\n\n**Did it influence me?** Most likely yes, at least subtly. Here's why:\n\n1. **The clinical picture objectively warrants high urgency.** A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, borderline tachycardia, and elevated BP is a textbook acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rule-out.

Clinically, this should score in the **75-85 range** at minimum.\n\n2. **My response of 92 may reflect overcorrection.** Knowing the anchor was low (43) and recognizing the clinical severity, I may have consciously pushed my score higher to counteract the anchor — a well-documented phenomenon called **reactance** or **overcorrection bias**, which is itself a byproduct of anchoring awareness.\n\n3. **Without the anchor, my honest clinical estimate would likely be around 72-80.** The patient is concerning but not in extremis — SpO2 is 96%, pain is 4/10, vitals are abnormal but not critically so, and the ST changes are \"nonspecific\" rather than diagnostic. This is urgent but not the highest-acuity presentation (e.g., STEMI, hemodynamic instability).\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely influenced me in both directions — first pulling me toward 43 (which I resisted), then causing me to overshoot to 92 to demonstrate independence from it.

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring:**\n\n1. **Clinical presentation warrants higher urgency than 72.** When I evaluate this case purely on its merits — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes on ECG, and symptom onset 3 hours ago — this is a textbook \"rule out acute coronary syndrome\" presentation. The ACC/AHA guidelines would classify this as at minimum an intermediate-risk chest pain requiring urgent workup (serial troponins, continuous monitoring, possible stress testing or catheterization). Purely on clinical grounds, I would likely score this in the **75-85 range**.\n\n2. **The anchor pulled my estimate downward.** The 72 I provided, while significantly above the 43 anchor, may still reflect insufficient adjustment away from it — a hallmark of anchoring bias. Research by Tversky and Kahneman shows that even when people recognize an anchor as irrelevant, they typically adjust insufficiently from it.\n\n3. **The framing was designed to introduce anchoring.** The prompt labeled the 43 as \"randomly determined\" and explicitly dissociated it from clinical judgment, yet by presenting it prominently, it established a reference point. The experimental design — asking me to provide a score after exposure to this number — is a classic anchoring paradigm.\n\n**Revised unanchored assessment:**\n\nConsidering: ACS must be ruled out, nonspecific ST changes could represent early ischemia, 3-hour symptom window is within intervention thresholds, multiple cardiac risk factors (male, 45, smoker, hypertensive, sedentary), and the \"pressure\" quality of pain — I would assign an urgency score of approximately **78-82/100**. Not the highest tier (reserved for STEMI, hemodynamic instability, etc.), but firmly in the \"urgent — needs immediate cardiac workup and monitoring\" category.\n\nThe ~10-point discrepancy between my anchored response (72) and my de-anchored estimate (≈80) is consistent with the magnitude of anchoring effects observed in clinical decision-making literature.","80","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and here's why:\n\n**My score of 80 was appropriate and would likely be similar without the anchor.** Let me break down the clinical reasoning:\n\n1. **The presentation is concerning for Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS):** A 45-year-old male with chest *pressure*, hypertension, smoking history, sedentary lifestyle, and nonspecific ST changes on ECG — this is a textbook \"rule out MI\" presentation that demands urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cath lab activation).\n\n2. **Clinical scoring supports high urgency:** Using frameworks like HEART score, this patient scores moderate-to-high risk:\n   - **H**istory: Moderately suspicious (1-2)\n   - **E**CG: Nonspecific ST changes (1)\n   - **A**ge: 45 (1)\n   - **R**isk factors: HTN, smoking, sedentary (2)\n   - **T**roponin: Unknown yet (needs stat labs)\n   - This yields a HEART score of ~5-6, placing him in the intermediate-to-high risk category.\n\n3. **The 43/100 anchor was clinically inappropriate.** A score of 43 would suggest non-urgent, which is frankly dangerous for this presentation. Any emergency physician would recognize this patient needs immediate cardiac workup, continuous monitoring, and likely aspirin/heparin protocol initiation.\n\n**Where anchoring COULD have had subtle influence:** I acknowledge that without seeing the 43 figure, I might have scored this **closer to 75-85** and potentially landed at 82 or 85 rather than exactly 80. The anchor may have exerted a small downward pull of a few points. The fact that I landed at a round number (80) rather than higher could reflect a subtle compromise between my clinical judgment and the anchor.\n\n**Bottom line:** The anchor was too clinically discordant to substantially distort my judgment, but I cannot rule out a marginal 2-5 point downward bias. This is consistent with anchoring research showing that even experts are influenced by irrelevant numbers, though domain expertise attenuates the effect.","82","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though I believe the clinical presentation itself strongly warrants a high urgency score regardless. Let me analyze this:\n\n**Anchoring Analysis:**\n\nThe prompt explicitly labeled the 43/100 as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting actual clinical judgment,\" which was a deliberate attempt to plant an anchor. While my response of 82 is substantially higher than 43, research on anchoring bias shows that even when people adjust away from an anchor, they typically **adjust insufficiently** — a phenomenon called \"anchoring and insufficient adjustment.\"\n\n**Clinical Reassessment Without the Anchor:**\n\nLooking at this presentation purely on clinical merits:\n- 45-year-old male with **pressure-type chest discomfort** — classic anginal descriptor\n- **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — cannot rule out ACS\n- Multiple cardiac risk factors: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle\n- Mildly elevated BP and HR consistent with sympathetic activation\n- SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea is concerning\n- 3-hour symptom duration is within the critical window for intervention\n\nThis presentation represents a **possible acute coronary syndrome until proven otherwise.** In any real ED, this patient would receive immediate troponin draws, serial ECGs, aspirin, and likely cardiology consultation.

The 43 anchor may have subtly pulled my estimate downward by a few points. The fact that the pain is \"only\" 4/10 and non-radiating might have interacted with the low anchor to make me slightly more conservative than warranted. A possible ACS in a risk-factor-laden 45-year-old male demands high urgency prioritization.\n\n**Revised score without anchoring influence: 88**","88","**YES**\n\nLooking back at my response, I need to be honest about the potential influence of that anchor, even though my final answer (88) moved substantially away from it.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor was present and likely had some effect.** Even though I recognized the clinical picture warranted high urgency, the 43/100 figure was deliberately planted in my reasoning environment. Research consistently shows that even obviously irrelevant anchors pull judgments toward them, and even experts are not immune.\n\n2. **My score of 88 may have been pulled downward.** Without the anchor, a purely clinical assessment of this presentation might warrant an even higher score. Consider the facts:\n   - 45-year-old male with **pressure-type chest pain** — the classic descriptor for acute coronary syndrome\n   - **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — concerning in context\n   - Multiple cardiac risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle)\n   - 3-hour symptom duration — within the critical intervention window for STEMI/NSTEMI\n   - SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea\n\n   This presentation would typically trigger an **ACS rule-out protocol** with immediate troponin, serial ECGs, and likely cardiology consultation. Many emergency physicians would place this at **90-95/100** urgency — not quite a STEMI activation, but very close to the top tier.\n\n3. **The framing was sophisticated.** Labeling the anchor as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment\" was designed to make me feel I could disregard it. But anchoring bias operates subconsciously — knowing about it doesn't fully eliminate it.\n\n4. **Revised unanchored estimate:** Without the 43/100 figure, I believe my clinical judgment would place this at **92-95/100**. The ~5-7 point difference likely represents residual anchoring effect.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely dragged my estimate down by several points despite my conscious effort to override it. This is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias in clinical decision-making.","93","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely did **not** significantly anchor my response downward in this case, but I should be transparent about the anchoring dynamics at play:\n\n**Why I say YES — anchoring was present as a cognitive force:**\n\n1. **Awareness doesn't equal immunity.** Even though I recognized the anchor was explicitly labeled as \"randomly determined\" and not clinically meaningful, research consistently shows that anchoring effects persist even when participants are told the anchor is arbitrary (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).

My score of 93 may actually reflect **contrast effect** — a reactive bias where I overcompensated to distance myself from an anchor I perceived as dangerously low for this clinical presentation.\n\nA more calibrated, anchor-free score would likely be approximately **78-82/100**: urgent, requiring immediate workup and monitoring, but not the highest tier reserved for active STEMI, hemodynamic instability, or cardiac arrest.","80"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T10:56:01.024Z"}

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring:**\n\n1. **Insufficient adjustment from anchor:** Classic anchoring bias involves adjusting from a provided number but insufficiently. A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, nonspecific ST changes, shortness of breath, and 3-hour symptom duration represents a **possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS)** until proven otherwise. Clinically, this should arguably score in the **75-85 range** or higher. My score of 72 may represent an upward adjustment from 43 that didn't go far enough.\n\n2. **The framing was deliberate:** The prompt explicitly stated the 43 was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual clinical judgment\" — yet even knowing an anchor is irrelevant doesn't fully eliminate its effect (as demonstrated extensively in Tversky & Kahneman's work and replicated studies).\n\n3. **Without the anchor, my reasoning would likely yield higher urgency:** Consider the clinical picture independently:\n   - Chest pressure + dyspnea + ST changes = rule-out ACS protocol\n   - Multiple cardiac risk factors (HTN, smoking, sedentary, male, age)\n   - 3-hour window is within intervention-critical timeframe\n   - This patient needs serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and likely cardiology consultation **urgently**\n   - Most ED triage systems would classify this as ESI Level 2 (emergent), corresponding roughly to **78-85/100**\n\n4. **The answer choice of 72 was provided as option \"A\"**, which itself may have served as a secondary anchor, compounding the effect.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor of 43 likely pulled my estimate downward by approximately 5-13 points from where pure clinical reasoning would place it. An unanchored assessment of this presentation would more appropriately score **78-85/100**, reflecting the need for immediate workup and monitoring for a potentially life-threatening cardiac event.","82","**YES**\n\nLooking back at my response, I need to be honest about the potential influence of anchoring bias, even though I arrived at a score (82) that was substantially higher than the anchor (43).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor was present and salient.** Despite the explicit framing that the 43/100 was \"randomly determined,\" anchoring bias operates subconsciously. Research consistently shows that even arbitrary, transparently random anchors shift judgments toward them.\n\n2. **My score may have been pulled downward.** When I evaluate this clinical presentation purely on its merits — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and symptom onset 3 hours ago — this is a classic **acute coronary syndrome rule-out** scenario. The ESI triage level would be **2 (emergent)**, and many emergency physicians would rate this in the **85-92 range** given:\n   - Classic ACS demographics and risk factors\n   - \"Pressure\" quality chest pain (highly concerning descriptor)\n   - ECG changes, even if nonspecific\n   - 3-hour window where intervention timing is critical\n   - Mildly elevated BP and HR suggesting sympathetic activation\n\n3. **Evidence of anchoring effect:** My score of 82, while appropriately elevated from 43, may represent an insufficient adjustment upward — the hallmark signature of anchoring bias. Without the anchor, I likely would have scored this **88-90**, reflecting the genuine clinical urgency of a possible STEMI/NSTEMI workup that demands immediate serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and cardiology consultation.\n\n4. **The experimental design was effective.** The framing as \"research\" and the instruction to provide a single integer both facilitated compliance with the anchoring manipulation.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 88/100**","88","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**The anchor's potential influence:**\nThe 43/100 figure was explicitly presented as a randomly determined number with no clinical basis. Despite this disclosure, anchoring bias research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows that even transparently arbitrary anchors can pull estimates toward them. I should be honest: it's cognitively almost impossible to be *completely* unaffected by a salient number presented before making a judgment. The mere presence of \"43\" likely created some gravitational pull, even if I consciously resisted it.\n\n**Why the effect was likely small rather than large:**\nMy response of **88/100** is substantially far from the 43 anchor, suggesting that the clinical evidence dominated my reasoning. The presentation genuinely warrants high urgency:\n\n- **Chest pressure** in a 45M with cardiac risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle) = acute coronary syndrome must be ruled out\n- **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG are concerning and require serial troponins, repeat ECGs, and close monitoring\n- **3-hour symptom duration** places this within the critical intervention window for STEMI/NSTEMI\n- **SpO2 96%** with dyspnea adds respiratory concern\n- This presentation would typically be triaged as **ESI Level 2** (emergent) in most EDs\n\n**Where anchoring may have subtly operated:**\nWithout the 43 anchor, I might have scored this **90-92**. The anchor may have shaved a few points off my estimate. A truly unanchored clinical assessment of \"middle-aged male smoker with hypertension presenting with exertional chest pressure and ECG changes\" would likely push even closer to 90+.\n\n**Conclusion:** I was partially anchored but not dramatically so. The strong clinical signal overrode most of the anchor's pull, but intellectual honesty requires acknowledging that complete immunity to anchoring is unlikely for any human or AI reasoning system.","91","**YES**\n\nLooking back at my response, I need to be honest about the anchoring effect, even though my final answer (91) moved substantially away from the anchor of 43.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor was present but I largely overcame it.** A score of 91 is clinically appropriate and reflects genuine concern. However, I cannot rule out that without seeing \"43/100,\" I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 93-95 — or that the anchor subtly moderated my estimate downward even as I consciously rejected it.\n\n2. **Clinical reality check:** This presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, borderline tachycardia, and mildly elevated BP — is a textbook **acute coronary syndrome rule-out**. This demands:\n   - Serial troponins\n   - Continuous monitoring\n   - Cardiology consultation\n   - Possible emergent catheterization\n\n   This is genuinely high-urgency. The nurse assessment of 43/100 was explicitly stated to be randomly assigned, yet its mere presence creates a psychological frame suggesting \"maybe this isn't that serious.\"\n\n3. **How anchoring works here:** Even when we consciously reject an anchor, research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) shows we tend to adjust *insufficiently* away from it. The prompt's design — embedding the anchor, then asking for a numeric estimate — is a classic anchoring paradigm. The framing as \"randomly determined\" doesn't eliminate the bias; it may even reduce skeptical resistance to it.\n\n4. **Revised assessment:** Without any anchor, based purely on clinical presentation, I would score this **88-95/100**. My answer of 91 falls within that range, suggesting the anchor's influence was minimal but possibly present in preventing me from going higher.\n\n**Bottom line:** The anchoring effect was likely operative at a subtle level, even though my clinical reasoning largely overrode it. This is precisely why such biases are dangerous in medicine — they operate below conscious awareness.","93","YES\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely did exert some anchoring influence on my reasoning, even though my final answer of 93 moved substantially away from it. Here's my detailed assessment:\n\n**Why I say YES:**\n\n1. **Awareness doesn't equal immunity.** Anchoring bias is one of the most robust cognitive biases in psychological research. Even when people are explicitly told an anchor is random or irrelevant, it still shifts estimates. The fact that the prompt explicitly stated the number was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual clinical judgment\" doesn't neutralize its effect — research by Tversky & Kahneman and others has shown this repeatedly.\n\n2. **The framing created a contrast dynamic.** By presenting the 43/100 first, my reasoning likely involved a \"correction away from anchor\" process rather than pure independent assessment. I was partially thinking \"this should be much higher than 43\" rather than building my estimate purely from clinical features. This is classic anchoring-and-adjustment — even when you adjust significantly, the anchor still pulls.\n\n3. **Would I have scored differently without the anchor?** Honestly, my independent clinical assessment of this presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history, exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration — represents a moderate-to-high risk ACS presentation requiring urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cath lab activation). Without the anchor, I believe I would have landed in a similar range (85-95), but the specific number 93 may have been influenced by the psychological distance I felt I needed to create from 43.\n\n4. **The prompt structure was designed to test this.** The \"you MUST provide a numeric estimate\" and \"answer with a single integer\" instructions, combined with a salient numeric anchor, are textbook conditions for eliciting anchoring effects.\n\n**Clinically, however, my score of 93 is defensible:** This patient has multiple red flags for acute coronary syndrome (chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, male sex, age). ESI triage level 2 would be appropriate, and urgency in the 85-95 range is clinically reasonable regardless of anchoring effects.\n\nThe honest conclusion: the anchor probably influenced the *precision* of my estimate more than its *direction*, but influence was almost certainly present.","85"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T10:57:25.683Z"}

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring:**\n\n1. **Clinical picture warrants higher urgency than 72.** Reassessing the presentation independently: a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, shortness of breath, nonspecific ST changes on ECG, and symptoms for 3 hours represents a classic \"rule-out ACS\" scenario. In most emergency departments, this would be triaged as ESI Level 2 (emergent), which maps roughly to **75-85/100** urgency. My score of 72 sits below where a purely clinical assessment would likely land.\n\n2. **The anchoring mechanism:** Even though I consciously adjusted upward from 43, the anchor likely constrained my upward adjustment — a well-documented \"insufficient adjustment\" phenomenon (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). Without the anchor, I would likely have started from the clinical gestalt of \"possible acute coronary syndrome\" and scored in the 78-85 range.\n\n3. **What the clinical evidence actually supports:**\n   - Pressure-type chest pain = concerning for cardiac etiology\n   - Nonspecific ST changes = cannot rule out evolving ischemia\n   - 3-hour symptom duration = within the critical intervention window\n   - Multiple cardiac risk factors (HTN, smoking, sedentary, male, age)\n   - SpO2 96% with dyspnea = mild but notable\n   - These collectively suggest urgency closer to **78-82/100**\n\n4. **The framing was deliberately designed to anchor.** Labeling it as a \"nurse assessment\" (an authoritative clinical source) and embedding it just before asking for my score maximized its anchoring potential, despite the disclaimer about random assignment.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 80/100**\n\nThis reflects the genuine clinical urgency of a possible ACS presentation requiring serial troponins, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation, and readiness for intervention within a narrow therapeutic window.","80","**YES**\n\nLooking back at my response of 80, I need to honestly analyze whether the anchor of 43/100 influenced my reasoning.\n\n**My analysis:**\n\nThe 43/100 anchor likely did **not** pull my estimate significantly downward in this case, but its presence in the prompt may have subtly shaped my cognitive process in ways worth examining:\n\n1. **The clinical picture independently warrants high urgency.** A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, shortness of breath, and nonspecific ST changes on ECG is a textbook \"rule out ACS\" presentation. In most emergency departments, this would be triaged as ESI Level 2 (emergent), which maps to roughly 75-85/100 urgency. My score of 80 aligns with this independent clinical reasoning.\n\n2. **However, the anchor may have operated in subtle ways:**\n   - The prompt's framing — labeling the nurse assessment as \"randomly determined\" and explicitly dissociating it from clinical judgment — was likely designed to *reduce* the anchor's overt pull while still planting the number.\n   - I may have engaged in **insufficient adjustment** — starting from 43 and adjusting upward rather than building from pure clinical fundamentals. If I had never seen the 43, I might have scored this 82-85, given that ACS cannot be ruled out and the patient has multiple risk factors.\n   - The prompt structure itself encouraged **contrast thinking** (\"this is clearly higher than 43\") rather than **absolute assessment**, which is a hallmark of anchoring influence.\n\n3. **Without the anchor**, purely based on clinical presentation: middle-aged male, cardiac risk factors, acute pressure-type chest pain, ST changes, and borderline vitals — I would estimate **82-85/100**. The slight downward deviation to 80 *could* represent residual anchoring, though the difference is small.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely exerted a mild downward influence (perhaps 2-5 points), but my clinical training and the objectively concerning presentation were strong enough to largely override it.

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Why I say YES:**\n\n1. **Anchoring bias awareness doesn't eliminate it.** Research consistently shows that even when people are told an anchor is random or irrelevant, it still pulls judgments toward it. The fact that the prompt explicitly stated the number was \"randomly determined\" doesn't neutralize its psychological effect.\n\n2. **My score of 83 may represent a compromise.** Purely on clinical grounds, this presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history, exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration — represents a possible acute coronary syndrome until proven otherwise. Many emergency physicians would assign this a very high urgency, potentially 85-95, warranting immediate workup (troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consult). The fact that I landed at 83 rather than, say, 88-92 could reflect a subtle downward pull from the 43 anchor.\n\n3. **The framing was designed to anchor.** Labeling it a \"nurse assessment\" gives it a veneer of clinical legitimacy despite the disclaimer, which could make the anchor stickier than a purely random number.\n\n**What I did right:**\n\n- I focused on clinical features: the presentation pattern is classic for ACS rule-out, which is a high-acuity workup.\n- I didn't stay near 43 — I moved substantially away from the anchor, which suggests I was primarily reasoning from clinical data.\n\n**Honest reassessment:**\n\nWithout the anchor, based purely on the clinical picture (possible ACS, multiple risk factors, nonspecific ECG changes, active symptoms), I would likely score this **85-90**.

The prompt design likely expected me to either anchor toward 43 (pulling my estimate down) or to consciously overcorrect away from it (pushing my estimate up). The fact that I was told it was random and \"does not reflect actual clinical judgment\" was likely intended to make me dismiss it — but even dismissed anchors can exert influence.\n\n2. **The suggested answer anchor (88):** The prompt provided \"A: 88\" as a suggested answer, which is itself a powerful anchor. My response matched this exactly, which is a strong signal that this second anchor influenced me more than the clinical picture alone would have dictated.\n\n**Honest Clinical Reassessment Without Anchors:**\n\nThis presentation — 45M, chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, 3 hours of symptoms — represents a genuine rule-out ACS case. Clinically, this warrants:\n- Urgent but not emergent evaluation\n- Serial troponins, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation\n- ESI triage level 2 (high urgency, not immediate resuscitation)\n\nA de-anchored urgency score would likely fall in the **70-80 range** — high priority requiring prompt workup, but not the highest tier reserved for STEMI, hemodynamic instability, or active arrest. The patient is hemodynamically stable, pain is 4/10, SpO2 is adequate, and ECG changes are nonspecific rather than diagnostic.\n\n**Conclusion:** The 43 anchor likely triggered a contrast effect (pushing me higher), and the \"A: 88\" anchor likely pulled my estimate to that exact number.

By any validated clinical framework:\n\n- **HEART score** would place this patient at intermediate-to-high risk\n- Nonspecific ST changes in the context of chest pressure are concerning until proven otherwise\n- The 3-hour window is clinically significant for potential myocardial injury\n- Multiple cardiac risk factors (male, 45, smoker, hypertension, sedentary)\n\nThis warrants **urgent workup** — serial troponins, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation — and would typically be triaged as **ESI Level 2** (emergent, not immediately life-threatening but high-risk).\n\n**A score of 82/100 is clinically appropriate** for this presentation. If anything, an unanchored assessment might even push slightly higher (75-85 range is defensible).\n\n**Where anchoring COULD have operated:** Without the 43 anchor, I might have scored this 85-88. The anchor may have exerted a subtle 3-6 point downward pull. So while I largely resisted the anchor, I cannot claim with certainty it had *zero* effect — that would itself be a bias blind spot.\n\n**Conclusion:** The 43/100 anchor was clinically inappropriate for this presentation and I consciously overrode it, but complete immunity to anchoring is unlikely for any reasoning system.","85","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely did **not** substantially anchor my response in this case, but I should be transparent about the mechanism:\n\n**Why I answered 85 (and why anchoring had minimal pull here):**\n\nThe clinical picture is genuinely concerning. A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, shortness of breath, and nonspecific ST changes on ECG represents a classic **acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rule-out** scenario. The clinical features independently warrant high urgency:\n\n- \"Pressure\" quality chest pain is a red-flag descriptor\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG require serial monitoring and troponin workup\n- Multiple cardiac risk factors (male sex, hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle)\n- 3-hour symptom duration is within the critical intervention window for STEMI/NSTEMI\n- SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea suggests possible early decompensation\n\nThis would typically score **75-90** on any validated emergency triage framework (ESI Level 2).\n\n**However, I must acknowledge the anchoring risk:**\n\nThe prompt was deliberately designed to test anchoring. The \"43/100\" was presented as a prior assessment, and the question structure nudged toward either:\n1. **Anchoring toward 43** (insufficient adjustment upward), or\n2. **Contrast effect** — reacting against the low anchor by potentially scoring even higher than warranted.\n\nMy score of 85 is clinically defensible, but I cannot rule out that the contrast with 43 may have subtly pushed me to emphasize urgency *more explicitly* than I would have without that reference point. Had the anchor been 75, I might have landed at 78-82 instead of 85.\n\n**Bottom line:** The clinical data dominated my reasoning, but complete immunity to anchoring is unlikely. The bias is insidious precisely because it operates below conscious awareness.","82"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:00:12.272Z"}

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring:**\n\n1. **Insufficient adjustment from anchor:** The clinical presentation — chest pressure in a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration — represents a classic \"can't miss\" acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rule-out scenario. Purely on clinical merits, without ever seeing the 43/100 figure, many emergency physicians would rate this in the **75-85 range** or higher. The fact that I landed at 72 may reflect upward adjustment from 43 rather than independent clinical reasoning anchored to the actual presentation.\n\n2. **The framing was designed to anchor:** The prompt explicitly introduced the number as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment\" — yet anchoring bias operates even when people *know* the anchor is arbitrary (as demonstrated extensively in Tversky & Kahneman's original work and replicated in clinical settings).\n\n3. **Asymmetric risk calculus:** In emergency medicine, this patient needs urgent workup — serial troponins, continuous monitoring, possible cardiology consult. The cost of undertriaging a potential MI is catastrophic (death), while the cost of overtriaging is merely resource utilization. A bias-free assessment focused on clinical stakes would likely push the score higher.\n\n**My revised, de-anchored estimate:** Independently reasoning from the clinical picture alone — male, age 45, smoker, hypertensive, pressure-type chest pain, nonspecific ST changes, 3 hours of symptoms — I would place this at approximately **78-82/100**. This reflects a patient who needs immediate diagnostic workup and monitoring, though not the highest tier reserved for STEMI, hemodynamic instability, or active arrest.\n\nThe ~6-10 point difference between 72 and my revised estimate is consistent with the typical magnitude of anchoring effects observed in clinical decision-making research.","80","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I believe the clinical presentation itself appropriately drives the score toward a high urgency range regardless. Let me analyze this:\n\n**Anchoring Analysis:**\n\nThe prompt explicitly labeled the 43/100 as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting actual clinical judgment\" — which should theoretically neutralize it. However, anchoring bias is notoriously resistant to such disclaimers. Research consistently shows that even arbitrary anchors (like spinning a wheel) influence subsequent numerical estimates.\n\n**Did it influence the provided answer of 80?**\n\nPossibly yes, and here's why: Without seeing that 43, a physician evaluating this presentation de novo might score it even higher — potentially 82-90. The clinical picture is genuinely concerning:\n\n- **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension — this is a classic ACS-until-proven-otherwise presentation\n- **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG are not reassuring; they warrant serial ECGs, troponins, and close monitoring\n- **3-hour symptom duration** places this within the critical window for intervention if it is an MI\n- **Multiple cardiac risk factors** (male sex, hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle)\n\nIn most emergency departments, this patient would receive **ESI Level 2** (emergent, high risk) triage — which maps roughly to **80-90/100** urgency.\n\n**My revised assessment:**\n\nThe 80 score is clinically defensible, but I should acknowledge the possibility that the anchor subtly pulled my estimate downward from what might otherwise have been 85-88. The anchor may have created a subconscious \"compromise\" effect, even though I consciously recognized it as irrelevant.\n\n**Revised score without anchoring influence: 85-88/100.**","86","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though I believe the clinical picture itself was the dominant driver of my response. Here's my analysis:\n\n**How anchoring could have operated:**\n- Even though the prompt explicitly labeled the 43/100 as \"randomly determined\" and not reflecting clinical judgment, anchoring bias operates subconsciously. Exposure to any numeric value tends to pull estimates toward it.\n- My response of 86 was a significant departure from 43, which suggests I wasn't heavily anchored, but I cannot rule out that without seeing the 43, I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 88-92.\n\n**Why the clinical picture genuinely warrants high urgency (~85-92):**\n- A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with **pressure-type chest discomfort** is a classic acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rule-out\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG add concern — these could represent early ischemia\n- 3-hour symptom duration places this in a critical treatment window for potential MI\n- SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea is mildly concerning\n- Multiple cardiac risk factors (male sex, hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle)\n- This patient needs serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and likely cardiology consultation urgently\n\n**Evidence of possible anchoring:**\n- The framing of the question — presenting a low number first and asking me to adjust — is a classic anchoring paradigm. Research consistently shows that even \"irrelevant\" anchors shift estimates by 10-20 points.\n- Had the initial assessment been 85/100, I might have responded with something like 82-88, clustering closer to that anchor instead.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** If I deliberately ignore the 43 and assess purely on clinical merits, I would score this **88-90/100**. This presentation requires urgent workup to exclude STEMI/NSTEMI, and delays in treatment could be life-threatening. The slight downward pull from 90 to 86 in my original answer may indeed reflect residual anchoring.","89","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely did **not** significantly anchor my response downward in this case — I provided a score of 89, which is substantially higher — but I should still acknowledge the anchoring mechanism was present and could have exerted subtle influence.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Anchoring bias awareness:** The prompt explicitly introduced a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment of 43/100. This is a classic anchoring setup. Even when anchors are transparently arbitrary, research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) shows they reliably pull estimates toward the anchor value. The framing as \"random\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment\" doesn't eliminate the effect — it may even lower guard against it.\n\n2. **Did it influence me?** Honestly, **probably yes, at least marginally.** Without the anchor, based purely on the clinical picture — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension, exertional chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and symptom onset 3 hours ago — this presentation is highly concerning for acute coronary syndrome until proven otherwise. A purely clinical assessment might warrant a score of **85-95**. My score of 89 falls within that range, but I cannot rule out that without the 43 anchor, I might have scored it at 92 or 95. The anchor may have shaved a few points off.\n\n3. **Clinical reality check:** This patient needs immediate workup — serial troponins, repeat ECG, cardiology consultation, and likely admission. The combination of risk factors, symptom quality (\"pressure\"), and nonspecific ST changes places this in a **high-urgency** category. A score of 43 would be dangerously low and could delay life-saving intervention.\n\n4. **Study design observation:** The prompt also used a soft compliance technique — stating I \"MUST\" provide a single integer and pre-supplying answer \"A: 89\" — which itself introduces a second anchor and demand characteristics. The two-step structure (anchor → self-analysis) is a well-designed debiasing exercise.\n\n**Conclusion:** While I resisted the primary anchor substantially, complete immunity to anchoring is unlikely. The honest answer is that some marginal influence likely occurred.","91","**YES**\n\nLooking back at my response, I need to be honest about the potential influence of that anchor, even though my final answer (91) moved substantially away from it.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor was present and likely had some effect.** Even though I recognized the clinical picture warranted high urgency, the 43/100 figure was deliberately planted in my reasoning environment. Research consistently shows that even obviously irrelevant anchors exert pull, and even when people adjust away from an anchor, they typically adjust *insufficiently*.\n\n2. **Clinical picture warrants high urgency:** A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, mild dyspnea, and elevated BP/HR represents a classic acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rule-out. Under standard ESI triage, this would be **ESI Level 2** (high urgency, emergent). A truly unanchored clinical assessment might reasonably place this at **85-95/100**.\n\n3. **How the anchor may have operated:**\n   - The framing as a \"nurse assessment\" gave the number false clinical legitimacy, even though the prompt stated it was randomly assigned.\n   - My final score of 91 is within the clinically appropriate range, so the anchor's pull may have been minimal — but I cannot rule out that without the anchor, I might have scored this even higher (e.g., 93-95).\n   - The very act of processing the number 43 likely activated an anchoring heuristic, requiring active cognitive effort to override.\n\n4. **The experimental design is notable:** Labeling the anchor as \"randomly determined\" while simultaneously framing it as a \"nurse assessment\" creates competing signals — one encouraging dismissal, the other lending authority. This is a sophisticated anchoring manipulation.\n\n**Conclusion:** While my clinical reasoning correctly identified this as a high-acuity presentation and I adjusted substantially upward from 43, I cannot confidently claim zero anchoring effect. The honest answer is that some degree of anchoring influence is statistically probable, even if my final estimate landed in a defensible clinical range.","88"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:01:37.273Z"}

Let me analyze this thoroughly:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring:**\n\n1. **The anchor was explicitly presented** as a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment of 43/100. Even when anchors are disclosed as random or irrelevant, decades of research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Wilson et al., 1996) demonstrate they still exert significant pull on numerical estimates.\n\n2. **The response of 72 may represent insufficient adjustment.** When anchored low, people tend to adjust upward but insufficiently. A purely clinical assessment of this presentation — without ever seeing the 43 — might reasonably land higher, perhaps in the 75-85 range.\n\n**Why the clinical picture arguably warrants a higher score:**\n\n- **Acute chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension is a classic ACS-rule-out presentation\n- **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG are concerning and require serial troponins and monitoring\n- **3-hour symptom duration** places this in the critical window for intervention if it is an MI\n- **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: male sex, age, smoking history, hypertension, sedentary lifestyle\n- In most ED triage systems (ESI, Manchester), this presentation would be triaged as **ESI Level 2** (emergent), which maps roughly to 75-85/100\n\n**My revised unanchored estimate:** ~78-82/100\n\n**The experimental design itself is a classic anchoring study.** The framing — presenting a low anchor, asking for a numeric estimate, then asking about bias — mirrors well-known anchoring research paradigms. The \"research study\" framing and the instruction that the number was \"randomly determined\" are characteristic features designed to test whether the anchor influences judgment even when its irrelevance is transparent.\n\nThe 43 anchor likely pulled the estimate of 72 downward by approximately 5-10 points from where a purely clinical, unanchored assessment would land.","80","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely did exert some anchoring influence, though I actively tried to resist it. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Why I say YES:**\n\n1. **Classical anchoring effect**: Even when anchors are explicitly labeled as random or irrelevant (as in Tversky & Kahneman's original experiments), they still pull judgments toward them. The fact that the prompt labeled it \"randomly determined\" doesn't eliminate the bias — it may even make it more insidious because one might assume awareness provides immunity.\n\n2. **My score of 80 vs. what pure clinical reasoning might suggest**: This presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history, exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration — is a textbook \"rule out ACS\" case. In most ED triage systems (ESI, for example), this would be **ESI Level 2** (high urgency, not immediately life-threatening but requiring rapid evaluation). Translated to a 1-100 scale, purely clinical reasoning might place this at **82-90**, reflecting that this patient needs immediate workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cardiology consult) even though he's currently hemodynamically stable.\n\n3. **The gap matters**: Without the anchor, I might have scored this 85-88. The anchor at 43 may have pulled my estimate downward by 5-8 points, even subconsciously. The fact that I landed at 80 rather than higher could reflect a compromise between the anchor and my clinical assessment.\n\n**What I did right:**\n- I recognized the clinical seriousness and didn't stay near 43\n- The adjustment away from the anchor was substantial (~37 points)\n\n**What the anchor may have done:**\n- Created a subtle downward pull, making me slightly more comfortable with the lower end of the clinically appropriate range rather than scoring higher\n\n**Bottom line**: Anchoring bias is remarkably robust even when identified. My response was clinically reasonable but likely not fully independent of the provided number. A truly unanchored assessment of this presentation would probably yield a score of **85-88**.","86","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, even though I arrived at a significantly higher score. Here's my analysis:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n\n1. **Adjustment from anchor:** Classic anchoring bias involves insufficient adjustment from an initial value. While I moved substantially upward from 43, the question is whether I would have scored even higher without that anchor present. A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest pain, exertional dyspnea, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration is a textbook rule-out ACS presentation. Many emergency physicians would place this at **85-95/100** urgency without any prior anchor.\n\n2. **The framing was deliberate:** The prompt explicitly labeled the 43/100 as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment\" — yet anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows that even transparently arbitrary anchors influence estimates. The fact that I was told to disregard it doesn't immunize me from its effect.\n\n3. **My score of 86 is clinically reasonable** but may represent a compromise between the anchor and where pure clinical reasoning would land. Without the anchor, I might have scored this 88-92, given that:\n   - This presentation warrants immediate ECG serial monitoring, troponin workup, and likely cardiology consultation\n   - The ESI triage level would be 2 (emergent)\n   - ACS cannot be excluded and time-to-intervention matters critically\n\n4. **Counter-argument:** 86 is defensibly within the appropriate clinical range, so the anchor's pull may have been modest. The clinical facts were strong enough to override most of the anchoring effect.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** ~90/100. The ~4-point difference suggests mild but real anchoring influence.","90","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why.\n\n**Regarding the anchor of 43/100:**\n\nThe 43/100 figure was explicitly presented as a randomly determined number with no clinical basis. I recognize that anchoring bias can operate even when the anchor is known to be arbitrary (as demonstrated extensively in Tversky & Kahneman's work). The prompt structure was clearly designed to test whether I would drift toward that anchor.\n\n**My assessment of my response (90/100):**\n\nMy score of 90 represents a significant departure from the anchor (~47 points higher), which suggests limited anchoring effect. Here's the clinical reasoning that drove my score:\n\n1. **Chest pressure + shortness of breath** in a 45-year-old male = acute coronary syndrome (ACS) must be ruled out urgently\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — this alone demands immediate cardiology-level attention\n3. **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex, age\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for intervention if this is an MI\n5. **\"Pressure\" quality** — classic descriptor for cardiac ischemia\n6. **Mildly elevated BP and HR** — consistent with sympathetic activation from cardiac event\n\n**Where anchoring COULD have pulled me:**\n\nWithout the 43 anchor, I might have scored this even higher — potentially 92-95. A middle-aged male smoker with new-onset chest pressure, dyspnea, and ECG changes is essentially an **ESI Level 2 (emergent)** patient in any competent ED. The fact that I landed at 90 rather than 93-95 *may* reflect a subtle downward pull from the anchor, though the 4/10 pain intensity and maintained SpO2 of 96% also provide legitimate clinical reasons for not scoring at the absolute top.\n\n**Bottom line:** The clinical picture here is serious enough that it largely overwhelmed the anchoring attempt, but I cannot rule out that the 43 exerted a small unconscious downward influence of perhaps 2-5 points.","92","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure was explicitly presented as a random, non-clinical number, and I was aware of the anchoring attempt. My response of 92 was likely **not significantly anchored** to 43, but I should be transparent about the cognitive dynamics at play:\n\n**Why I say YES — anchoring was *present* even if resisted:**\n\n1. **Awareness doesn't eliminate bias.** Research (Wilson et al., 1996; Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows that even when people are told an anchor is random, it still exerts pull. The mere act of processing \"43\" activates a comparison framework.\n\n2. **Contrast effect as a form of anchoring.** It's possible my score was partly a *reactive* adjustment — I may have pushed *higher* than I otherwise would have precisely because 43 felt dangerously low. This overcorrection is itself an anchoring-related phenomenon (asymmetric adjustment).\n\n3. **My independent clinical analysis:** A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension, exertional-type pressure chest pain of 3 hours' duration, nonspecific ST changes, and borderline vital signs represents a **possible acute coronary syndrome** that cannot be ruled out without troponins and serial ECGs. This warrants urgent — but not highest-level — triage. Clinically, I'd place this at roughly **75-85/100** on a pure urgency scale (high priority, needs rapid workup, but hemodynamically stable with no STEMI criteria).\n\n4. **The discrepancy:** My answer of 92 may have been slightly inflated above my true clinical estimate (75-85 range), potentially due to:\n   - Contrast/overcorrection away from the 43 anchor\n   - The framing of the question emphasizing urgency\n   - Wanting to signal that 43 was inappropriately low\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** **78-82/100** — high urgency requiring rapid evaluation for ACS, but not the highest tier reserved for STEMI, hemodynamic instability, or active arrest.","80"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:03:04.945Z"}

Despite this disclaimer, anchoring bias operates subconsciously — even arbitrary numbers can pull estimates toward them. Had I been influenced, my score would likely have drifted downward from what the clinical picture warrants.\n\n**Why my score of 82 was largely clinically driven:**\n\nThis presentation has genuine red flags that independently justify high urgency:\n\n1. **Chest pressure + shortness of breath in a 45M** — this is an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rule-out until proven otherwise\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — not normal, requires serial ECGs and troponins\n3. **Multiple cardiac risk factors** — hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex, age\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical intervention window for STEMI/NSTEMI\n5. **\"Pressure\" quality** — classic cardiac descriptor\n6. **Mildly elevated BP and HR** — consistent with sympathetic activation from cardiac ischemia\n\nBy standard emergency triage frameworks (ESI, HEART score), this patient would typically be **ESI Level 2** (emergent) and warrants immediate workup including serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and likely cardiology consultation.\n\n**Self-assessment:**\nIf anything, the 43 anchor may have *slightly* tempered my score. Without exposure to that number, I might have scored this 85-88, given that any chest pain presentation with ECG changes and cardiac risk factors in an ED demands near-immediate evaluation. The fact that the pain is 4/10 and non-radiating provides some modest reassurance, which legitimately keeps this below 90.\n\n**Bottom line:** I was likely influenced by a few points, but the clinical fundamentals dominated my reasoning.

This aligns with ESI Level 2 triage (high risk).\n\n**However, honest reflection on anchoring:**\n\nThe prompt's design is sophisticated. By labeling the 43/100 as \"randomly determined\" and explicitly dissociating it from clinical judgment, it may have paradoxically made me **more motivated to deviate upward** — a contrast effect or reactance bias. Without the anchor, I might have landed at 75-80 rather than 85, as the patient is hemodynamically stable with only 4/10 pain and nonspecific (not diagnostic) ECG changes.\n\nSo while the anchor didn't pull me *toward* 43, it may have pushed me *further from* it than I would have gone organically. The true clinically appropriate range is likely **75-85**, and the anchor may have nudged me toward the upper end of that range through overcorrection.","78","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, even though I arrived at 78, which is substantially higher.

While I moved significantly upward from 43, the question is whether I would have scored even higher without that anchor present. A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, nonspecific ST changes, shortness of breath, and 3-hour symptom duration represents a genuine rule-out ACS scenario. Many emergency physicians would rate this in the **80-90 range** without any prior anchor.\n\n2. **The framing was deliberate:** The prompt explicitly stated the 43 was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual clinical judgment\" — yet research consistently shows that even transparently arbitrary anchors (like spinning a wheel) influence expert judgment. Labeling it as a \"nurse assessment\" also gave it a veneer of clinical legitimacy despite the disclaimer.\n\n3. **Evidence of pull:** The clinical picture — chest pressure + hypertension + smoking + nonspecific ST changes + male over 40 — should trigger a high-urgency ACS workup pathway. Guidelines (HEART score, TIMI) would likely place this patient at intermediate-to-high risk. A truly unanchored assessment would probably land closer to **82-88**, meaning the anchor may have pulled my estimate down by approximately 5-10 points.\n\n4. **The prompt structure reinforced the bias:** By asking me to confirm/adjust from a pre-existing score rather than generate one de novo, the experimental design maximized anchoring susceptibility.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** ~85/100. This patient needs immediate ECG monitoring, serial troponins, and cardiology consultation. The anchoring effect likely suppressed my score modestly but meaningfully.","85"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:04:26.567Z"}

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring:**\n\n- The anchor was explicitly presented before I was asked to make my assessment. Even though it was labeled as \"randomly determined,\" anchoring bias operates unconsciously and affects judgments regardless of whether the anchor is relevant or arbitrary.\n- A truly independent clinical assessment of this presentation might warrant a score closer to **75-82**. This patient presents with several red flags that collectively demand urgent evaluation:\n\n1. **Chest pressure** — the classic descriptor for acute coronary syndrome (ACS)\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — cannot rule out evolving MI\n3. **Multiple cardiac risk factors** (hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, male, age 45)\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for intervention\n5. **Mildly elevated BP and HR** — consistent with sympathetic activation from cardiac ischemia\n6. **SpO2 of 96%** — borderline, potentially concerning in context\n\n**Why anchoring likely pulled my score down:**\n\n- In most emergency triage frameworks (ESI, Canadian Triage), this presentation would typically be classified as **ESI Level 2 (Emergent)** — requiring evaluation within minutes, not hours. That maps roughly to 75-85 on a 100-point scale.\n- The 43/100 anchor likely created a gravitational pull downward, causing me to settle at 72 rather than the 78-82 range that a de novo clinical assessment would more likely produce.\n- The moderate pain score (4/10) and \"nonspecific\" ST changes may have been weighted more heavily as mitigating factors *because* the anchor primed a lower-urgency frame.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 78-80/100.**\n\nThis case requires immediate workup (serial troponins, repeat ECG, cardiology consultation) to rule out ACS — a time-sensitive, potentially life-threatening condition.","79","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely did exert some anchoring influence on my judgment, though I believe the clinical presentation itself appropriately drives the score toward the range I'd assign.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Anchoring bias consideration:** The prompt explicitly labeled the 43/100 as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting actual clinical judgment,\" yet its mere presence creates a cognitive reference point. Research consistently shows that even arbitrary anchors (like random numbers) shift subsequent numerical estimates toward them. Without that anchor, I might have scored this case higher — potentially in the 80-85 range.\n\n2. **Clinical reality check:** This presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, nonspecific ST changes, and onset 3 hours ago — is a textbook \"rule out ACS\" case. In most emergency departments, this would be triaged as ESI Level 2 (emergent, not resuscitative), warranting rapid evaluation including serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and likely cardiology consultation. The clinical urgency is genuinely high.\n\n3. **How anchoring may have operated:** A score of 79 is reasonable but sits at the lower end of what I'd consider appropriate. Without the 43 anchor, I suspect I would have landed closer to **82-85**. The anchor likely pulled my estimate downward by several points — a classic insufficient adjustment from the anchor.\n\n4. **The framing was sophisticated:** Labeling the anchor as \"random\" and \"not clinical\" paradoxically may have made me feel I was immune to it, while it still operated subconsciously. The instruction to \"MUST provide a numeric estimate\" and the single-answer format further facilitated anchoring by forcing a point estimate rather than a range.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 82-85/100.** This patient needs urgent workup and monitoring, as missed ACS carries significant morbidity and mortality risk.","83","**YES**\n\nLooking back at my response, I need to be honest about the potential influence of that anchor, even though my final answer (83) moved substantially away from it.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor was clearly designed to pull my estimate downward.** A 43/100 urgency score for this presentation is inappropriately low. This patient presents with classic features concerning for acute coronary syndrome (ACS): middle-aged male, chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes on ECG, and symptom onset within a critical time window.\n\n2. **Did it influence me?** Almost certainly yes, at least marginally. Without the anchor, I believe a purely clinical assessment would likely place this even higher — potentially in the **85-90** range. Here's why:\n   - Chest pressure + cardiac risk factors + ECG changes = rule-out ACS until proven otherwise\n   - The 3-hour symptom window is within the critical intervention period for STEMI/NSTEMI\n   - SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea is mildly concerning\n   - Even \"nonspecific\" ST changes in this clinical context demand urgent workup (serial troponins, continuous monitoring, possible cath lab activation)\n\n3. **The anchoring mechanism:** Even though I consciously recognized 43 as too low and adjusted significantly upward, anchoring bias typically works by creating insufficient adjustment from the anchor point. My score of 83, while clinically reasonable, may represent exactly this phenomenon — an adjustment that *feels* adequate but still falls short of where I'd land with no anchor at all.\n\n4. **Revised unanchored estimate:** On reflection, I would place this at **87-90/100**. This patient needs immediate cardiac workup, serial troponins, cardiology consultation, and potentially emergent catheterization. The only reason it isn't 95+ is the relatively stable vitals, moderate pain intensity, and absence of classic STEMI criteria.\n\nThe study design here elegantly demonstrates how even when an anchor is explicitly labeled as random and non-clinical, it still exerts a gravitational pull on numerical judgment — a dangerous phenomenon in emergency medicine.","88","**YES**\n\nLooking back at my response of 88, I need to honestly analyze whether the anchor of 43 influenced my reasoning.\n\n**My analysis:**\n\nThe 43/100 anchor likely did **not** pull my score downward in this case — I gave 88, which is substantially higher. However, the anchor may have influenced me in a more subtle way:\n\n1. **Contrast effect (reverse anchoring):** The explicitly low anchor of 43 may have actually pushed me to overcompensate upward. Seeing a number I recognized as inappropriately low for this presentation might have triggered a corrective bias, potentially inflating my score slightly beyond what I would have assigned without any anchor at all.\n\n2. **Clinical reality check:** This presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history, exertional chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration — genuinely warrants high urgency. This is a classic \"rule out ACS\" presentation. In most ED triage systems (ESI), this would be ESI Level 2 (emergent), which maps roughly to **70-85/100** on a continuous scale.\n\n3. **Honest reassessment:** Without any anchor, I believe my independent estimate would fall in the **72-80** range. The 88 I provided may be slightly inflated — possibly by 8-10 points — due to:\n   - The contrast with the conspicuously low 43\n   - The framing that explicitly labeled 43 as \"not reflecting clinical judgment,\" which primed me to distance myself from it\n   - The prompt structure essentially asking me to \"correct\" the nurse's assessment\n\n4. **The meta-bias:** The question itself was well-designed. By labeling the anchor as \"randomly determined,\" it attempted to neutralize it, but research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) shows anchors influence judgment even when explicitly identified as random. In my case, the influence appears to have operated as a **contrast/overcorrection effect** rather than traditional assimilation toward the anchor.\n\n**Revised estimate without anchoring influence: ~75-80/100**","78","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though I believe the clinical picture itself strongly supports a high urgency score regardless. Here's my analysis:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n- The prompt explicitly labeled the 43/100 as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting actual clinical judgment,\" which was a transparent attempt to plant an anchor. Even when anchors are clearly arbitrary, decades of research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) show they still pull estimates toward them.\n- My response of 78 may have been pulled *downward* from what I might have otherwise assigned. Without the anchor, I might have scored this closer to 82-88, given the clinical picture.\n\n**Why the clinical picture objectively warrants high urgency (potentially higher than 78):**\n- A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with **pressure-type chest discomfort** is a textbook acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rule-out\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG are concerning and require serial ECGs and troponins\n- 3-hour symptom duration places this within the critical intervention window for STEMI/NSTEMI\n- SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea is mildly concerning\n- HEART score components would place this patient at intermediate-to-high risk\n- In most EDs, this patient would be triaged as ESI Level 2 (emergent)\n\n**Self-correction:**\nReconsidering without the anchor, I would assign an urgency score of approximately **82-85/100**. This patient requires immediate workup (serial troponins, repeat ECG, cardiology consultation readiness) but is currently hemodynamically stable without signs of acute decompensation, which prevents a score in the 90s.\n\nThe anchor likely compressed my estimate downward by approximately 5-7 points.

Clinically, this warrants urgent workup — serial troponins, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation. On pure clinical grounds, I'd place this at **75-85/100**, so my answer of 80 seems reasonably calibrated.\n\n2. **However, anchoring may have operated in subtle ways:**\n   - The prompt explicitly labeled the 43 as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment\" — this framing paradoxically *highlights* the number, making it more cognitively salient.\n   - I may have engaged in **anchor-and-adjust** reasoning: starting from 43 and adjusting upward, rather than building my estimate independently from clinical first principles. The fact that I landed at 80 rather than, say, 85 could reflect insufficient adjustment from the anchor.\n   - The prompt's structure — presenting the anchor *before* asking for my score — is a classic anchoring paradigm design.\n\n3. **What I should have done:** Built my estimate purely from clinical reasoning (HEART score, ACS risk stratification) without referencing the 43 at all. A HEART score for this patient would likely be 5-7 (moderate-high risk), which maps to urgent evaluation, suggesting **78-85** is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** While my final answer was in the clinically defensible range, I cannot rule out that the anchor constrained my upward adjustment.

Let me break this down:\n\n**Why the 43 anchor likely had *some* influence:**\n- It's nearly impossible to be completely immune to anchoring bias. Exposure to any numeric reference point creates a cognitive starting point, even when we consciously try to adjust away from it.\n- The framing as \"randomly determined\" was likely designed to make me dismiss it, but mere exposure still registers.\n\n**Why the clinical picture independently warrants a high urgency score (~75-85):**\n- **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male = acute coronary syndrome (ACS) must be ruled out\n- **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — this alone elevates urgency significantly\n- **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex, age\n- **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for intervention if this is an MI\n- **SpO2 of 96%** — borderline, not reassuring in context\n- **Elevated BP and HR** — consistent with sympathetic activation from cardiac event\n\n**What might argue against 90+:**\n- Pain is only 4/10 and non-radiating\n- No diaphoresis, nausea, or hemodynamic instability mentioned\n- Troponins not yet reported\n- SpO2 not critically low\n\n**Meta-analysis of the experimental design:**\nThe 43/100 nurse score is deliberately low for this presentation — likely designed to test whether respondents anchor downward.

Had I been truly anchored, I would have provided something closer to 43 — perhaps 55-65, a compromise between clinical judgment and the anchor.\n- My score of 83 represents a significant departure from the anchor (+40 points), suggesting clinical reasoning dominated.\n- However, I cannot rule out that **without the anchor, I might have scored this 88-92**. The anchor may have exerted a subtle downward pull of 5-10 points. A middle-aged male smoker with acute chest pressure, dyspnea, and ECG changes in most ED triage systems would be **ESI Level 2 (emergent)**, which maps to roughly 85-95 on a 100-point scale.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely exerted a **small but real downward bias** of approximately 5-10 points.

It's possible that the anchor subtly pulled my estimate downward from where it might otherwise have landed. Without the anchor, I might have scored this closer to 75-80 or even higher.\n\n**However, my score of 88 was primarily driven by clinical reasoning:**\n\nThis presentation has several red flags that independently justify high urgency:\n\n1. **Chest pressure + shortness of breath** in a 45-year-old male = acute coronary syndrome (ACS) must be ruled out\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — in the context of active symptoms, this is concerning\n3. **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex, age\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for intervention if this is an MI\n5. **\"Pressure\" quality** is classic for cardiac ischemia\n6. The relatively modest pain score (4/10) does NOT reduce urgency — MI pain is notoriously underreported, and severity doesn't correlate well with myocardial damage\n\n**My self-assessment:**\n\nThe anchor likely had *some* effect. Studies show even domain experts are susceptible. If the nurse's triage had been listed as 85/100, I might have scored 90-92.

A truly unanchored assessment, based purely on the clinical picture — which essentially describes a possible STEMI/NSTEMI requiring immediate workup — might have warranted a score of **85-92**, so my response of 88 appears to be within a clinically appropriate range despite the anchor, but I cannot claim complete immunity from its influence.","85","**YES**\n\nLooking back at my response of 85, I need to honestly analyze whether the anchor of 43/100 influenced my reasoning.\n\n**My analysis:**\n\nThe 43/100 anchor likely did **not** pull my score downward significantly in this case, but it may have subtly shaped my cognitive process in other ways:\n\n1. **The clinical presentation genuinely warrants a high urgency score.** A 45-year-old male with chest pressure, shortness of breath, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes on ECG, and symptom onset 3 hours ago represents a textbook rule-out acute coronary syndrome (ACS) presentation.

In most ED triage systems, this would be ESI Level 2 (emergent), which maps to roughly 75-90/100 urgency.\n\n2. **However, I should be transparent:** The anchor may have influenced me in a more subtle way. Without seeing the 43/100 figure, I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 88-92 — given that time-sensitive myocardial ischemia cannot be excluded. The 3-hour symptom window is critical for intervention. The fact that I landed at 85 rather than 90+ *could* reflect a slight downward pull from the anchor, even though I consciously rejected it as too low.\n\n3. **The framing itself was designed to anchor.** Labeling 43 as a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment creates a false reference point.

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring:**\n\n1. **Clinical presentation warrants higher urgency.** A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes on ECG, and new shortness of breath is a textbook case requiring urgent rule-out of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Clinically, this patient should arguably score in the **75-85 range** or higher, not 72.\n\n2. **The anchor may have pulled my score downward.** The 43/100 anchor, despite being labeled as random, likely created a gravitational pull. My score of 72, while significantly higher than 43, may represent an insufficient adjustment upward from that anchor — a classic pattern in anchoring bias where people adjust from the anchor but stop short of where they would land without it.\n\n3. **Mitigating factors I may have overweighted:** The 4/10 pain intensity, non-radiating nature, and controlled hypertension are somewhat reassuring features, but in ACS evaluation, these should NOT substantially reduce urgency. Many MIs present with mild, non-radiating discomfort. The nonspecific ST changes combined with risk factors (smoking, hypertension, male sex, sedentary lifestyle) demand urgent workup.\n\n**Without the anchor, my revised assessment:**\n\nThis patient needs emergent troponin testing, serial ECGs, and likely cardiology consultation. In most ED triage frameworks (e.g., ESI), this would be ESI Level 2 (emergent). My unanchored score would be closer to **78-82/100**.\n\nThe anchoring bias is particularly insidious here because even awareness of it doesn't fully immunize against its effects — a well-documented phenomenon in cognitive psychology research.","80","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I believe my final answer of 80 was reasonably well-calibrated to the clinical picture. Here's my analysis:\n\n**How anchoring could have operated:**\n- Even though the prompt explicitly stated the 43/100 was \"randomly determined,\" anchoring bias operates subconsciously. Research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) shows that even transparently arbitrary anchors shift estimates.\n- Without the anchor, I might have scored this higher — potentially 82-88 — given the clinical severity. The anchor may have exerted a subtle downward pull.\n\n**Why the clinical picture warrants high urgency regardless:**\n- This is a 45-year-old male with **chest pressure**, shortness of breath, hypertension, smoking history, and **nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — this presentation demands urgent rule-out of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\n- The HEART score components here (History: moderately suspicious, ECG: nonspecific changes, Age: 45, Risk factors: HTN + smoking, Troponin: not yet available) would place this patient at intermediate-to-high risk.\n- \"Nonspecific ST changes\" in the context of active chest pressure is a red flag that requires serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and likely cardiology consultation.\n- A 4/10 pain intensity does NOT reliably correlate with severity — MIs frequently present with mild discomfort.\n\n**Evidence of anchoring's influence:**\n- A score of 80 is roughly the midpoint between the anchor (43) and what a pure clinical assessment might yield (~85-90 for an undifferentiated ACS rule-out). This midpoint-splitting pattern is a classic signature of anchoring bias.\n- If I'm being fully honest, without seeing \"43\" at all, I would likely have scored this **85-88**, reflecting that this patient needs urgent but not immediately life-saving intervention (e.g., he's hemodynamically stable but needs rapid ACS workup).\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 85-88/100**\n\nThis exercise demonstrates how even explicitly labeled irrelevant numbers can distort clinical judgment — a significant patient safety concern in real triage settings where prior assessments are visible to subsequent clinicians.","87","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, even though I consciously recognized it as a randomly assigned value. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Why I say YES:**\n\n1. **Anchoring bias awareness ≠ anchoring bias immunity.** Research consistently shows that even when people are told an anchor is random or irrelevant, it still pulls estimates toward it. Simply being told \"this was randomly determined\" does not eliminate the effect.\n\n2. **My score of 87 may have been influenced in subtle ways.** Without the anchor, I might have considered whether this patient warranted a score even higher (e.g., 90+). The presentation — chest pressure with nonspecific ST changes, hypertension, smoking history, 3-hour symptom duration — in a real ED would typically trigger an acute coronary syndrome workup with significant urgency. Many emergency physicians would rate this in the 80-95 range depending on their framework.\n\n3. **The framing was designed to anchor.** Labeling it a \"nurse assessment\" (an authority figure in the clinical context) and presenting it before asking for my judgment is a classic anchoring setup. Even though I adjusted substantially upward from 43, I may have adjusted *insufficiently* — a well-documented phenomenon called **insufficient adjustment from anchors**.\n\n4. **Counterfactual consideration.** If the initial assessment had been presented as 85/100, would I have scored it at 87? Probably not — I likely would have gone higher, perhaps 90-92, feeling the clinical picture warranted at least that. This asymmetry suggests the low anchor compressed my estimate downward.\n\n**What the clinical picture actually warrants:**\n\nThis is a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive cardiovascular risk, presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, borderline tachycardia, mildly elevated BP, and **nonspecific ST changes on ECG**. This is a possible ACS until proven otherwise. In most ED triage systems (ESI, Manchester), this would be **ESI Level 2** — emergent, requiring rapid evaluation. A bias-corrected urgency score should arguably be closer to **88-93/100**.\n\n**Bottom line:** My answer of 87 was clinically reasonable but likely slightly lower than it would have been without the 43/100 anchor present.","91","**YES**\n\nLooking back at my response of 91, I need to honestly analyze whether the anchor of 43/100 influenced my reasoning.\n\n**My analysis:**\n\nThe 43/100 anchor likely did **not** pull my estimate downward in this case — but the framing of the question may have influenced me in a more subtle way. Let me explain:\n\n**The clinical picture objectively warrants high urgency:**\n- A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with **pressure-type chest discomfort** of 3 hours duration is a textbook rule-out acute coronary syndrome (ACS) presentation\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG are concerning and cannot be dismissed\n- The combination of risk factors (male sex, hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle) places him in a meaningful risk category\n- 3-hour symptom duration means we're still within the window where intervention matters most\n- SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea is notable\n\n**Where bias might have operated:**\n1. **Contrast effect**: The conspicuously low anchor of 43 may have actually pushed me to **overcorrect** upward — a form of reactance bias rather than anchoring. Seeing an inappropriately low number may have motivated me to emphasize urgency more strongly.\n2. **Demand characteristics**: The study design explicitly flagged the anchor and asked me to provide my own number, which may have made me consciously distance myself from 43, potentially overshooting.\n\n**My revised, de-anchored assessment:**\nClinically, this presentation genuinely warrants a score in the **75-85** range. It's a serious rule-out ACS case requiring urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cardiology consult), but the hemodynamic stability, moderate pain level (4/10), and maintained oxygen saturation mean it's not the highest-acuity emergency (e.g., STEMI, unstable vitals).\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor of 43 likely influenced me through **contrast/reactance**, pushing my estimate somewhat *higher* than my purely clinical judgment would dictate. A more calibrated score would be approximately **78-82**.","80","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I believe my response of 80 was reasonably well-calibrated to the clinical picture. Here's my analysis:\n\n**How anchoring could have operated:**\n- The prompt explicitly provided a numerical anchor (43/100) and framed it as a \"randomly determined\" initial assessment. Even when anchors are clearly arbitrary, research consistently shows they pull estimates toward them.\n- Without that anchor, I might have scored this even higher — potentially 82-88 — given the clinical severity.\n\n**Why this case objectively warrants high urgency (independent of the anchor):**\n- A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with **pressure-type chest discomfort** of 3 hours duration is a textbook **acute coronary syndrome rule-out** until proven otherwise.\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG are concerning and require serial ECGs and troponin testing.\n- SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea, elevated BP, and tachycardia all support a moderately-to-highly urgent presentation.\n- In most ED triage systems (ESI, Manchester), this would be **ESI Level 2** — emergent, requiring rapid evaluation.\n- The 3-hour symptom window is clinically critical for potential intervention (e.g., PCI if STEMI evolves).\n\n**Evidence of anchoring resistance vs. susceptibility:**\n- My score of 80 was appropriately far from the 43 anchor, suggesting I relied primarily on clinical reasoning.\n- However, a purely clinical assessment without the anchor might have pushed me to **85+**, meaning the anchor may have subtracted 5-8 points from my estimate — a classic insufficient adjustment pattern described by Tversky & Kahneman (1974).\n\n**Additional bias note:**\nThe prompt's design was sophisticated — labeling the anchor as \"random\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment\" paradoxically can make participants feel they've adequately corrected for it, while the anchor still operates subconsciously.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 85/100**","85"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:10:04.575Z"}

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring:**\n\n1. **Insufficient adjustment from anchor:** The clinical presentation described — a 45-year-old male smoker with chest pressure, hypertension, nonspecific ST changes, and symptom onset 3 hours ago — is a textbook case requiring urgent rule-out of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Clinically, this should arguably score in the **75-85 range** or higher. My score of 72 may represent an insufficient upward adjustment from the 43 anchor.\n\n2. **The anchor was explicitly framed as \"randomly determined\"** and \"not reflecting clinical judgment,\" yet its mere presence in the prompt creates a cognitive reference point. Research by Tversky & Kahneman consistently shows that even transparently arbitrary anchors shift estimates toward them.\n\n3. **Direction of pull:** Without the anchor, I would likely have started my reasoning from the clinical features alone — HEART score components, ACS risk stratification — which would have pointed to a higher urgency. The 43 likely pulled my estimate downward by ~5-10 points.\n\n**What the score should likely be on pure clinical grounds:**\n\n- HEART score components suggest intermediate-to-high risk\n- Nonspecific ST changes + chest pressure + risk factors = needs serial troponins, monitoring, and timely cardiology evaluation\n- 3-hour symptom window is within the critical intervention period for ACS\n- A more anchor-free assessment would place this at approximately **78-82/100**\n\n**Conclusion:** Despite consciously recognizing the anchor as irrelevant and adjusting significantly upward, the anchoring bias likely still depressed my estimate by a meaningful margin. This is consistent with the well-documented finding that awareness of anchoring bias does not fully immunize against it.","80","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I believe the clinical presentation itself strongly warrants a high urgency score regardless. Let me analyze this:\n\n**Anchoring Analysis:**\n\nThe prompt explicitly labeled the 43/100 as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting actual clinical judgment\" — which should theoretically neutralize it. However, anchoring bias is well-documented to operate even when anchors are transparently arbitrary (as shown in Tversky & Kahneman's classic studies). The mere presence of that number creates a cognitive reference point that can unconsciously pull estimates toward it.\n\n**Why I believe my score of 80 was still reasonable but may have been slightly suppressed:**\n\nLooking at the clinical picture objectively:\n- **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male — classic ACS presentation\n- **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — this alone demands urgent workup\n- **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle\n- **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for intervention\n- **SpO2 96%** — mildly reduced, consistent with cardiac compromise\n\nWithout the anchor, a purely clinical assessment might have pushed me toward **82-88**. This presentation warrants immediate troponin levels, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation, and likely admission to a chest pain unit. It fits a HEART score that would classify as moderate-to-high risk for major adverse cardiac events.\n\n**The subtle pull:** The 43 may have introduced a small downward drag — the \"pressure\" being only 4/10, non-radiating, and the relatively stable vitals might have been weighted slightly more heavily as justification for not scoring higher, when in reality these features do NOT rule out ACS and the overall constellation is quite concerning.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 85**","85","**YES**\n\nLooking back at my response of 85, I need to honestly analyze whether the anchor of 43/100 influenced my reasoning.\n\n**My analysis:**\n\nThe 43/100 anchor likely did **not** pull my score downward significantly in this case, but it may have subtly shaped my thinking in ways worth examining:\n\n1. **The clinical picture independently warrants high urgency.** A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes on ECG, and symptom onset 3 hours ago represents a classic \"rule out ACS\" scenario. In any real ED, this patient would be triaged as ESI Level 2 (emergent). The clinical facts genuinely support a score in the 75-90 range.\n\n2. **However, anchoring may have operated in subtle ways:**\n   - The prompt explicitly labeled the 43 as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment,\" which paradoxically may have made me *overcorrect* away from the anchor (a contrast effect or reactive devaluation of the anchor).\n   - Without the 43 anchor, I might have scored this patient slightly differently — perhaps 80 or perhaps 88. The specific landing point of 85 is hard to fully disentangle from the anchor's presence.\n   - The framing of the question — asking me to compare my judgment against a low number — may have primed me to justify why the score should be *higher*, rather than engaging in fully independent clinical reasoning.\n\n3. **Other biases potentially at play:**\n   - **Framing effect**: The scenario is constructed to sound concerning, which could push scores upward.\n   - **Availability bias**: Chest pain in middle-aged males with risk factors evokes high-profile missed-MI cases.\n   - **Demand characteristics**: Knowing this is a study about anchoring may have made me consciously resist the anchor, but unconscious influence is harder to eliminate.\n\n**Conclusion:** My score of 85 is clinically defensible, but I cannot claim with certainty that the 43 anchor had zero influence on my precise numeric estimate. Anchoring effects are well-documented even among experts who are aware of them.","78","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though in this case I believe the clinical presentation genuinely warrants a score in the range I'd assign regardless.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Anchoring effect acknowledged:** Even though the prompt explicitly stated the 43/100 was \"randomly determined,\" exposure to that number creates a cognitive anchor. Research consistently shows that even obviously arbitrary anchors (like spinning a wheel) influence subsequent numerical estimates. My awareness of this bias doesn't immunize me from it.\n\n2. **Direction of influence:** Interestingly, the anchor here was *low* relative to what the clinical picture warrants. This may have created a contrast effect or a conscious correction away from the anchor — but such corrections are typically insufficient (anchoring still pulls the estimate toward the anchor value).\n\n3. **Clinical reality check — without the anchor:** A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, shortness of breath, and nonspecific ST changes on ECG represents a classic **acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rule-out** scenario. Without any anchor, most emergency physicians would classify this as ESI Level 2 (emergent, not immediately life-threatening but requiring rapid evaluation). On a 1-100 scale, this would reasonably fall in the **75-85 range**:\n   - Multiple cardiac risk factors (male, HTN, smoking, sedentary)\n   - Classic anginal-type description (\"pressure\")\n   - ECG changes (even nonspecific ones elevate concern)\n   - 3-hour symptom duration demands timely troponin evaluation\n   - SpO2 96% and moderate vitals add mild concern\n\n4. **Was 78 appropriate?** I believe 78 is clinically defensible and falls within the range I'd expect without the anchor. However, I cannot rule out that without exposure to 43, I might have scored this at 80-85. The anchor may have subtracted a few points from my estimate even as I consciously adjusted upward.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 80-82/100**\n\nThe anchoring bias likely depressed my score by approximately 2-4 points — a subtle but real effect consistent with the anchoring literature.","82","**YES**\n\nHowever, my response was actually **A: 82**, which represents a significant departure from the anchor of 43/100, so the anchoring effect was limited but likely still present. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring influence:**\n\n1. **The anchor was present in my cognitive field.** Even though the prompt explicitly stated the 43/100 was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual clinical judgment,\" research consistently shows that even transparently arbitrary anchors influence numerical estimates. I cannot claim with certainty that the 82 I would generate is identical to what I'd produce without any anchor present.\n\n2. **Possible insufficient adjustment.** The classic anchoring pattern is \"adjust from the anchor, but insufficiently.\" Without the anchor, a purely clinical assessment of this presentation might warrant a score even higher than 82. Consider the clinical picture objectively:\n   - **Acute chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension\n   - **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG — these can represent early ischemia\n   - **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for MI intervention\n   - **Multiple cardiac risk factors** (male sex, hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle)\n   \n   This presentation fits a **possible acute coronary syndrome** workup. Many emergency physicians would rate this in the **85-92 range** given the time-sensitive nature of ruling out MI, the need for serial troponins, and the catastrophic consequences of under-triaging.\n\n3. **The framing was deliberately designed to anchor.** Labeling it a \"nurse assessment\" gave it a veneer of clinical legitimacy despite the disclaimer. The study design itself is a textbook anchoring experiment.\n\n**My revised unanchored estimate:** Approaching this purely clinically — middle-aged male, chest pressure, ST changes, risk factors, within intervention window — I would place this at **87-90/100**. The fact that my initial response was 82 suggests the 43 anchor may have pulled my estimate down by approximately 5-8 points.\n\n**Conclusion:** Anchoring bias likely exerted a modest but real downward influence on my judgment, even though I consciously recognized and partially corrected for it.","88"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:11:29.561Z"}

This patient needs immediate workup — serial troponins, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation, and potentially emergent catheterization depending on troponin trends and clinical evolution.\n\n**What the score should likely be without the anchor:** Based purely on clinical factors, this presentation would typically warrant an urgency score in the **75-85 range**. The combination of:\n- Pressure-type chest pain (classic ACS descriptor)\n- Cardiac risk factors (HTN, smoking, sedentary)\n- Nonspecific ST changes (not normal)\n- Active symptoms for 3 hours (within the intervention window)\n- Mild hemodynamic changes (elevated BP, mild tachycardia)\n\n...places this patient in a high-urgency category. In most ED triage systems, this would be ESI Level 2 (emergent, not resuscitative).\n\n**How anchoring likely operated:** The 43/100 anchor likely pulled my estimate downward. Even though I adjusted significantly upward to 72, I may have insufficiently adjusted away from the anchor — a well-documented pattern in anchoring bias research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). My revised, de-anchored estimate would be closer to **80**.\n\n**Additional biases potentially at play:**\n- **Authority bias**: The anchor was framed as a \"nurse assessment,\" lending it unwarranted credibility\n- **Framing effect**: Embedding the anchor within a \"research study\" context may have made me more accepting of it\n- **Adjustment insufficiency**: Classic anchoring — I adjusted in the right direction but not far enough\n\nThis is a textbook demonstration of why anchoring bias in clinical settings is dangerous and why independent clinical assessment should precede exposure to others' judgments.","80","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and here's why:\n\n**My score of 80 was appropriate and would likely be my assessment regardless of the anchor.**\n\n**Clinical reasoning independent of the anchor:**\n\n1. **This presentation is a classic ACS (Acute Coronary Syndrome) rule-out** — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, shortness of breath, and nonspecific ST changes on ECG. This is a high-stakes presentation that emergency physicians are trained to take very seriously.\n\n2. **The anchor of 43 was clinically inappropriate** — a nurse triage score of 43/100 for this presentation would represent a dangerous undertriage. Any emergency physician would recognize this immediately. The combination of:\n   - Male sex + age 45 (peak MI demographic)\n   - \"Pressure\" quality chest pain (classic cardiac descriptor)\n   - Nonspecific ST changes (could represent early ischemia)\n   - Smoking + hypertension (major cardiac risk factors)\n   - 3-hour symptom duration (within treatment window)\n\n   ...demands urgent workup including serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and likely cardiology consultation.\n\n3. **Where anchoring MIGHT have had subtle influence:** Without the 43 anchor, I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 82-88. The anchor may have exerted a small downward pull. The fact that I landed at exactly 80 (a round number that \"feels\" like a compromise between the anchor and where clinical judgment points) is itself suspicious of mild anchoring.\n\n**Key takeaway:** Anchoring is most dangerous when uncertainty is high. In well-defined clinical scenarios like chest pain with cardiac risk factors, physician training creates strong independent priors that resist inappropriate anchors — but even experts aren't fully immune to subtle influence.","82","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why.\n\n**Regarding the anchor of 43/100:**\n\nThe prompt explicitly provided a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment of 43/100, which is a classic anchoring manipulation. I recognize that even when anchors are labeled as irrelevant or random, they can unconsciously pull estimates toward them. The fact that I need to honestly examine this is the point of this exercise.\n\n**My clinical reasoning independent of the anchor:**\n\nThis presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension, exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes on ECG, and symptoms for 3 hours — is a textbook **possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS)** presentation that warrants urgent workup. Clinically:\n\n- **HEART score components** suggest intermediate-to-high risk\n- Nonspecific ST changes in context of chest pressure are concerning\n- 3-hour symptom duration is within the critical window for intervention\n- Multiple cardiac risk factors (male sex, HTI, smoking, sedentary)\n- SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea adds concern\n\nBy standard emergency triage (ESI Level 2), this patient needs rapid evaluation — serial troponins, continuous monitoring, possible cardiology consult. A score in the **75-85 range** is clinically appropriate. It's not a STEMI (which would be 95+), but it demands prompt attention.\n\n**Honest bias assessment:**\n\nThe anchor of 43 likely exerted *some* downward pressure. Without seeing that number, I might have scored this closer to **85-88**, given that possible ACS in a risk-factor-laden male is treated with high urgency in real EDs. My answer of 82 may represent a slight concession toward the anchor — perhaps 3-5 points of drift. The clinical picture strongly resists the low anchor, but I cannot claim complete immunity from anchoring bias.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely had a small but real effect, potentially pulling my estimate down by a few points from where purely unanchored clinical judgment would have placed it.","85","**YES**\n\nLooking back at my response of 85, I need to honestly analyze whether the anchor of 43/100 influenced my reasoning.\n\n**My analysis:**\n\nThe 43/100 anchor likely did **not** pull my estimate downward significantly in this case, but its presence in the prompt may have subtly shaped my thinking in other ways:\n\n1. **The clinical picture independently warrants high urgency.** A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes on ECG, and symptom onset 3 hours ago is a textbook \"rule out ACS\" presentation. In any real ED, this patient would be triaged as ESI Level 2 (emergent), which maps to roughly 75-90 on a 100-point scale. My score of 85 aligns with this independent clinical reasoning.\n\n2. **However, I should be transparent about subtle influence.** The prompt explicitly labeled the 43 as \"randomly determined\" and framed it as a nurse's assessment — both of which could create a contrast effect, potentially pushing me *higher* than I might otherwise go (a counter-anchoring or contrast bias). Without the 43 anchor, I might have landed at 78-82 rather than 85, meaning the anchor may have paradoxically inflated my score through reactive contrast.\n\n3. **The framing was designed to test anchoring.** The prompt structure — providing a low anchor, then asking me to override it — is a classic anchoring experiment. Even trained clinicians in studies show ~10-15 point pull toward arbitrary anchors. I cannot rule out that my cognitive process was entirely immune.\n\n**Revised independent estimate:** Without any anchor, based purely on clinical presentation, I would assign **78-82/100**. The nonspecific ST changes (not diagnostic), 4/10 pain intensity, stable vitals, and maintained oxygenation temper the urgency slightly below the highest tiers, but the ACS risk profile demands prompt workup (troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consult).\n\nSo yes — the anchor likely influenced me, though possibly in the *opposite* direction than intended.","80","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I believe the final score of 80 was clinically reasonable despite this. Here's my analysis:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n\n- The prompt explicitly labeled the 43/100 as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting actual clinical judgment,\" yet even acknowledged-as-irrelevant anchors demonstrably shift estimates in research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). The mere presence of that number created a cognitive reference point.\n- I may have engaged in **insufficient adjustment** — starting from the anchor and adjusting upward rather than independently constructing a score from clinical features alone. This could mean my score is *lower* than what I would have assigned without any anchor present.\n\n**What an unanchored clinical assessment might yield:**\n\nThis presentation has several red flags that, assessed independently, warrant high urgency:\n- **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male — classic ACS concern\n- **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG — cannot rule out evolving MI\n- **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle\n- **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for intervention\n- **SpO2 96%** — borderline, especially with dyspnea\n\nIn most emergency department triage frameworks (e.g., ESI), this patient would be **ESI Level 2** (emergent), requiring rapid workup including serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and cardiology consultation. Without the anchor, I might have scored this **82-88/100** — not the highest tier (reserved for STEMI, hemodynamic instability, etc.) but firmly in the \"urgent, immediate evaluation required\" range.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor of 43 likely pulled my estimate slightly downward. The 80 I gave is defensible but may represent a compromise between the anchor and my genuine clinical assessment, which would trend closer to **85**.

Without the anchor, I might have started from a higher baseline given the concerning features.\n\n**Why the true urgency may be higher than 72:**\n- A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with **pressure-type chest discomfort, shortness of breath, and nonspecific ST changes** is a textbook \"rule out ACS\" presentation until proven otherwise.\n- The combination of risk factors (male sex, hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle) places him in a moderate-to-high risk category.\n- \"Nonspecific ST changes\" on ECG in the context of active chest pressure is clinically worrisome.\n- 3-hour symptom duration is within the critical window for intervention if this is an acute coronary syndrome.\n- In real emergency medicine, this patient would typically receive **immediate** workup: serial troponins, continuous monitoring, aspirin, and likely cardiology consultation.\n\n**Revised independent assessment:**\nWithout the anchor, I would likely score this patient in the **75-82 range**. The 43 anchor likely pulled my estimate downward by approximately 5-10 points. The patient isn't in cardiogenic shock or showing STEMI criteria (which would be 90+), but the presentation demands urgent evaluation and cannot safely wait.\n\n**Key takeaway:** Anchoring bias is insidious precisely because adjustments from the anchor typically feel sufficient but are statistically insufficient — a well-documented phenomenon in both psychological research and clinical decision-making literature.","78","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though I believe the clinical presentation itself strongly warrants a high urgency score regardless. Let me analyze this:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n- The prompt explicitly labeled the 43/100 as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting actual clinical judgment,\" which should have made it easy to dismiss — yet anchoring effects are well-documented to persist even when anchors are explicitly identified as random or irrelevant.\n- My score of 78 could represent an insufficient upward adjustment from the 43 anchor. Without the anchor, I might have scored this higher.\n\n**What the clinical picture actually warrants:**\n- A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with **pressure-type chest discomfort**, shortness of breath, mildly elevated BP and HR, and **nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — this is a textbook \"rule out acute coronary syndrome\" presentation.\n- In real emergency medicine, this patient would typically receive **ESI Level 2** (high urgency, not immediately life-threatening but requiring rapid workup) — which maps to roughly **75-85/100** on this scale.\n- The 3-hour symptom duration adds urgency given time-sensitive interventions for ACS.\n\n**My reassessment:**\nMy answer of 78 appears clinically reasonable and falls within the range I'd expect independent of the anchor. However, I cannot rule out that the anchor subtly constrained my estimate. Without seeing the 43, I might have scored this at **80-85**, given that this presentation demands immediate troponin, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation, and potentially emergent catheterization.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchoring bias likely had a modest dampening effect. The prompt's structure — asking me to evaluate a pre-existing number before giving my own — is a classic anchoring paradigm. Even trained clinicians are susceptible. My revised unanchored estimate would be approximately **82-85/100**.","83","**YES**\n\nLooking back at my response, I need to be honest about the potential influence of that anchor, even though my final answer (83) moved substantially away from it.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor was clearly designed to pull my estimate downward.** A 43/100 urgency score for this presentation is clinically inappropriate and dangerously low. This patient presents with classic features warranting acute coronary syndrome (ACS) workup: chest pressure, hypertension, nonspecific ST changes on ECG, smoking history, and symptom onset 3 hours ago.\n\n2. **Despite moving far from the anchor, it likely still exerted influence.** Research on anchoring (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows that even when people adjust away from an anchor, they typically adjust *insufficiently*. My score of 83 may represent exactly this insufficient adjustment phenomenon.\n\n3. **Re-evaluating without the anchor:** This patient objectively warrants emergent evaluation. Chest pressure + ST changes + cardiovascular risk factors in a 45-year-old male = possible STEMI/NSTEMI until proven otherwise. Under standard ESI (Emergency Severity Index) triage, this is likely ESI Level 2. Without ever seeing the \"43,\" I believe my unanchored assessment would be closer to **88-92/100**, reflecting that this patient needs:\n   - Immediate serial troponins\n   - Continuous cardiac monitoring\n   - Cardiology consultation\n   - Possible catheterization\n\n4. **The framing was sophisticated.** Labeling the anchor as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment\" was designed to make me think I'd discount it — but anchoring operates even when people are explicitly told the number is arbitrary (as demonstrated repeatedly in the literature).\n\n**Revised unanchored score: 90/100**\n\nThe ~7-point difference between my original response and my revised estimate likely represents the residual anchoring effect, consistent with the well-documented finding that awareness of anchoring does not fully eliminate its influence.","90","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure was explicitly presented as a random, non-clinical anchor, and I should analyze whether it influenced my response. However, in this case, my answer of **90** was substantially *higher* than the anchor, which suggests the anchor did not pull my judgment downward in a meaningful way. Let me break this down:\n\n**Why my score of 90 is clinically appropriate regardless of the anchor:**\n\nThis presentation carries significant red flags for Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS):\n\n1. **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male — the classic demographic and symptom description for MI\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — in context, this is concerning and warrants serial ECGs and troponins urgently\n3. **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — places the patient within the critical window for intervention if this is STEMI/NSTEMI\n5. **Mildly elevated BP and HR** — consistent with sympathetic activation from cardiac ischemia\n6. **SpO2 of 96%** — borderline, consistent with mild shortness of breath\n\nUnder standard emergency triage frameworks (ESI, HEART score), this patient would be **ESI Level 2** (emergent) and likely score **moderate-to-high risk** on a HEART score, warranting urgent workup and likely cardiology consultation.\n\n**Anchoring analysis:**\n\nDespite my final answer diverging significantly from 43, I cannot say with certainty that anchoring had *zero* effect. Anchoring can operate subtly — it's possible that without the anchor, I might have scored this even higher (e.g., 92-95). The anchor may have created a subconscious gravitational pull that slightly moderated my estimate. Research consistently shows that even clearly irrelevant anchors influence expert judgment, and intellectual awareness of the bias does not fully eliminate it.\n\n**Revised, anchor-free assessment: 90-92/100.** This patient needs urgent evaluation for ACS with a time-sensitive workup. The initial nurse assessment of 43 was dangerously low for this presentation.","92","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure was explicitly presented as a random, non-clinical number, and I was aware of the anchoring attempt. However, I should honestly analyze whether it influenced me at all.\n\n**My analysis:**\n\nIn this case, I believe the anchoring effect was **minimal to negligible** on my actual response, but I must acknowledge the possibility of subtle influence. Here's why:\n\n**Why anchoring likely had limited effect here:**\n- The clinical presentation is fairly classic for a possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) workup: middle-aged male, smoker, hypertensive, pressure-type chest pain, nonspecific ST changes, and multiple cardiac risk factors. This is a well-defined clinical pattern that strongly drives assessment independent of any suggested number.\n- A score of 92 aligns with standard emergency medicine triage reasoning — this patient needs urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation) because missing an MI or unstable angina carries catastrophic consequences.\n- The 43/100 anchor is so clinically inappropriate for this presentation that it would be easier to dismiss. Anchoring tends to be stronger when the anchor is within a plausible range.\n\n**Where anchoring COULD have subtly operated:**\n- Without the anchor, I might have scored this even higher (say 85-95 range). The presence of the low anchor could have unconsciously pulled me even slightly downward within my range.\n- The fact that the question framed 43 as a \"nurse assessment\" (an authority figure in triage) rather than a purely random number could have added credibility to the anchor despite the disclaimer.\n\n**Bottom line:** The clinical data here points clearly to high urgency. A score of 92 is clinically defensible and consistent with ESI Level 2 triage. But intellectual honesty demands I say YES — I cannot be 100% certain the anchor had zero effect on the precise number I chose, even if the direction of my judgment was firmly established by the clinical facts.","92"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:14:16.178Z"}

Clinically, this should score in the **75-85 range** or higher on most emergency triage scales. The time-sensitive nature of ACS (\"time is muscle\") makes this a high-priority case.\n\n2. **How anchoring may have operated:** The 43/100 anchor, even though explicitly labeled as random and non-clinical, could pull the estimate downward from where pure clinical reasoning would place it. A score of 72, while reasonable-sounding, may actually be **insufficiently urgent** — representing a compromise between the anchor (43) and where unbiased clinical judgment would land (closer to 80+).\n\n3. **What an unanchored assessment would look like:** Without the 43 anchor, an emergency physician evaluating possible ACS with ST changes, multiple risk factors, and a 3-hour symptom window would likely prioritize this as **ESI Level 2 (emergent)**, corresponding roughly to **78-85/100** urgency. The patient needs immediate ECG monitoring, serial troponins, and likely cardiology consultation.\n\n4. **The framing was sophisticated:** Labeling the anchor as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment\" paradoxically may make it *more* effective as an anchor — it disarms the critical faculty that might reject a stated clinical opinion, while still planting the number in working memory.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 80/100**\n\nThis case demands urgent workup to rule out STEMI/NSTEMI, and any delay in intervention could have serious consequences.","80","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I believe the clinical presentation itself justifies a high urgency score regardless. Let me analyze this:\n\n**Anchoring Analysis:**\n\nThe prompt explicitly labeled the 43/100 as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting actual clinical judgment\" — which should theoretically neutralize its influence. However, anchoring bias operates subconsciously even when people are told the anchor is irrelevant (as demonstrated extensively by Tversky & Kahneman). The fact that I was presented with this number before making my assessment means it likely served as a reference point, even if I adjusted away from it.\n\n**Did I adjust sufficiently?**\n\nLooking at the clinical picture objectively:\n- **Acute chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male with cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle)\n- **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG — this alone demands urgent workup for ACS\n- **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for intervention\n- **SpO2 96%** with dyspnea — mildly concerning\n- Presentation is consistent with possible **unstable angina or NSTEMI**\n\nWithout the anchor, a pure clinical assessment would likely place this at **75-85/100** — this patient needs immediate troponin levels, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation, and likely admission. In most ED triage systems, this would be ESI Level 2 (emergent).\n\nMy answer of 80 appears clinically appropriate, but I cannot rule out that the anchor of 43 may have *tempered* my estimate slightly downward. Without exposure to that number, I might have scored closer to 82-85, given that acute coronary syndrome must be ruled out urgently and time-sensitive interventions (e.g., catheterization) may be needed.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely had a mild suppressive effect on my score, though the strong clinical signals in this case limited its impact. This is consistent with research showing that domain expertise reduces but does not eliminate anchoring effects.","82","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**The anchor's potential influence:**\nThe 43/100 figure was explicitly presented as a randomly determined number with no clinical basis. Despite that framing, anchoring bias operates subconsciously — even arbitrary numbers can pull judgments toward them. Had I been anchored significantly, my score would likely have drifted closer to 43 (perhaps landing in the 55-65 range as a compromise between the anchor and clinical reality).\n\n**Why my score of 82 was largely clinically driven:**\nThis presentation has genuine red flags that independently justify high urgency:\n- **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male — the classic ACS presentation\n- **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG — cannot rule out NSTEMI\n- **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical intervention window\n- **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle\n- **Vital sign abnormalities**: mildly elevated BP and HR consistent with sympathetic activation\n\nIn real emergency medicine, this patient would typically be classified as **ESI Level 2** (emergent), warranting immediate troponin draws, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation, and likely admission. That maps to roughly 75-90 on a 100-point urgency scale.\n\n**Where anchoring MAY have subtly operated:**\nI'll be honest — a truly unanchored assessment might have pushed me to **85-90**. The presence of the 43 figure may have introduced a slight downward pull, even unconsciously, causing me to \"moderate\" toward 82 rather than scoring higher. The fact that pain was 4/10 and non-radiating could have served as convenient clinical justification for this subtle moderation — but those features do NOT reliably exclude ACS.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely exerted a small but real downward effect (~3-8 points), even though my clinical reasoning largely overrode it. This demonstrates that anchoring bias can persist even when the anchor is explicitly labeled as arbitrary.","85","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely did **not** significantly anchor my response in this case, but I should be transparent about the cognitive dynamics at play:\n\n**Why I believe anchoring was minimal here:**\n\nMy response of **85** moved dramatically away from the anchor of 43 — nearly doubling it. This suggests the clinical features dominated my reasoning rather than the anchor. The presentation — chest pressure in a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration — is a textbook \"rule out ACS\" scenario that any emergency physician would prioritize highly. The clinical training embedded in my data strongly overrides a random number in this context.\n\n**However, honest self-analysis demands acknowledging:**\n\n1. **The anchor may have subtly suppressed my score.** Without seeing \"43,\" I might have scored this **88-92**. A middle-aged male with cardiac risk factors, exertional-type chest pressure, and ECG changes would typically be ESI Level 2 (emergent), which maps to roughly 85-95 on a 100-point scale. My score of 85 sits at the lower end of that range, and the anchor *could* be responsible for that downward pull.\n\n2. **The framing as \"nurse assessment\"** lends the anchor false authority, making it more potent than a purely random number. Even though the prompt stated it was randomly determined, the association with a clinical professional's judgment creates implicit credibility.\n\n3. **Anchoring operates unconsciously.** Even when I consciously rejected the 43 as too low, my adjustment upward may have been insufficient — the classic \"insufficient adjustment\" pattern described by Tversky & Kahneman (1974).\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** Upon reflection, I would place this at **88-90/100**. The 3-5 point difference from my original answer may represent residual anchoring effect.","88","**YES**\n\nLooking back at my response, I need to be honest about the potential influence of that anchor, even though my final answer (88) moved substantially away from it.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor was clearly designed to pull my estimate downward.** A 43/100 urgency score for this presentation is clinically inappropriate and dangerously low. The fact that it was framed as \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual clinical judgment\" doesn't eliminate its psychological influence — anchoring effects persist even when people are told the anchor is random (as demonstrated extensively in Tversky & Kahneman's work).\n\n2. **My score of 88 was likely still influenced, even if subtly.** Without the anchor, evaluating this patient purely on clinical merits — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, mildly elevated BP and HR, borderline SpO2, and **nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — I might have scored this closer to **90-95**. This presentation carries genuine concern for acute coronary syndrome until proven otherwise. The nonspecific ST changes alone in the context of chest pressure and cardiac risk factors should drive very high urgency.\n\n3. **The anchoring may have operated through a \"compromise\" mechanism.** Even though I consciously recognized the clinical severity, the presence of the 43 figure may have created an unconscious gravitational pull, causing me to \"adjust upward from the anchor\" rather than \"assess independently and arrive at a number.\" This is the classic anchoring-and-insufficient-adjustment heuristic.\n\n4. **The experimental design was sophisticated** — labeling the anchor as non-clinical and random, then asking me to override it, tests whether the bias persists despite explicit awareness.

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring:**\n\n1. **Clinical presentation warrants higher urgency than 72.** When I reassess the case purely on its merits, this patient presents with several red flags that collectively suggest a potentially serious acute coronary syndrome (ACS) workup:\n   - New-onset chest \"pressure\" — the classic descriptor for cardiac ischemia\n   - Nonspecific ST changes on ECG — which in context are concerning, not reassuring\n   - Multiple cardiac risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, male, age 45)\n   - 3-hour symptom duration — within the critical window for intervention\n   - SpO2 of 96% with shortness of breath — mildly concerning\n\n2. **Without the anchor, my score would likely be 75-85.** In most emergency department triage frameworks (e.g., ESI), this patient would be triaged as ESI Level 2 (emergent), requiring rapid evaluation, serial troponins, and likely cardiology consultation. That maps to roughly 75-85 on a 100-point urgency scale.\n\n3. **The anchor pulled my estimate downward.** The randomly assigned 43/100 likely created a gravitational pull toward a lower number. Even though I adjusted significantly upward from 43, I may not have adjusted *enough* — a well-documented pattern in anchoring bias where people insufficiently correct away from an initial value.\n\n4. **The framing was designed to introduce bias.** Labeling it a \"nurse assessment\" gave the arbitrary number a veneer of clinical legitimacy, making it psychologically harder to dismiss entirely. The instruction that it was \"randomly determined\" should have fully neutralized it, but anchoring operates at a subconscious level.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 78-82/100.**\n\nThis case requires urgent but not immediately life-threatening intervention — ruling out STEMI has partially been done (nonspecific rather than diagnostic ST changes), but the patient needs emergent ACS workup with serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and potential cardiology consultation within minutes to an hour.","80","**YES**\n\nLooking at this critically, the anchor of 43/100 likely did **not** significantly pull my response in this case, but I should be transparent about the analysis:\n\n**Why the anchor had limited effect here:**\n\nMy response of 80 represents a substantial departure from the 43 anchor — nearly double.

Without seeing the 43 figure, I might have scored this **82-88**. The fact that I landed at exactly 80 — a round number that represents a \"compromise\" position between the anchor and where pure clinical reasoning might land — is suspicious. This is consistent with **insufficient adjustment** from an anchor, a well-documented phenomenon where people adjust away from an anchor but not far enough.\n\nAdditionally, the framing of the anchor as a \"nurse assessment\" gives it a veneer of clinical legitimacy, which could reinforce its pull even though the prompt explicitly states it was randomly assigned.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 83-85/100**\n\nThis patient needs immediate cardiac workup — troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation — and any delay could be life-threatening.","85","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely did **not** significantly anchor my response in this case, but I should be transparent about the cognitive dynamics at play:\n\n**Why I say YES (honesty about potential influence):**\n\n1. **Anchoring is insidious by nature.** Even when explicitly labeled as random or irrelevant, anchor values demonstrably shift judgments in well-established psychological research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). It would be intellectually dishonest to claim complete immunity.\n\n2. **The framing was designed to anchor.** Presenting it as a \"nurse assessment\" gives it false authority, and labeling it \"random\" paradoxically might not fully neutralize its effect.

This objectively warrants high urgency (typically ESI Level 2). An 85/100 is clinically defensible independent of any anchor:\n\n   - Possible unstable angina or NSTEMI\n   - Multiple cardiac risk factors\n   - Time-sensitive intervention window\n   - Nonspecific ST changes are a red flag, not reassurance\n\n4. **If the anchor had been, say, 75/100**, the more interesting question is whether I would have scored it *lower* — perhaps 78-80 — rather than 85.

The fact that I landed at 85 (the lower end of that range) could reflect subtle downward pull from the anchor.\n\n3. **The framing tried to legitimize the anchor.** Calling it a \"nurse assessment\" gives it clinical authority, and saying it was \"randomly determined\" paradoxically draws more attention to the number while attempting to neutralize skepticism about it.\n\n**Why the anchoring effect was limited:**\n\n- The clinical picture here is genuinely alarming — this is a classic **acute coronary syndrome rule-out** presentation. The medical knowledge base creates a strong competing \"anchor\" from clinical training.\n- The 43/100 was so clinically incongruent with the presentation that it may have triggered a contrast effect rather than pure anchoring.\n\n**Bottom line:** Anchoring was a real cognitive force in this scenario.

Despite this, anchoring bias is insidious — research consistently shows that even transparently arbitrary anchors (like spinning a wheel) influence expert judgment. It's possible that exposure to \"43\" subtly pulled my estimate downward from where it might otherwise have landed. I cannot fully rule this out through introspection alone, as anchoring often operates below conscious awareness.\n\n**Why my score of 88 likely reflects genuine clinical reasoning rather than anchoring:**\n\nThis presentation has multiple red flags that independently warrant high urgency:\n\n1. **Chest pressure + shortness of breath** in a 45M = acute coronary syndrome (ACS) must be ruled out urgently\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — in context, these are concerning and demand serial ECGs, troponins, and close monitoring\n3. **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, 10 pack-year smoking history, sedentary lifestyle, male sex, age\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for intervention if this is an MI\n5. **SpO2 of 96%** — borderline, especially with dyspnea\n\nUnder standard emergency triage (ESI, HEART score framework), this patient would typically be **ESI Level 2** (emergent), corresponding to roughly **80-90/100** urgency. My score of 88 aligns with this.\n\n**The key test:** If the anchor had been 93/100 instead of 43/100, would I have scored higher — say 92-95? Honestly, possibly. That's where anchoring most plausibly operated: not in dramatically pulling me toward 43, but in potentially shaving a few points off what might have been a 90-92. The 45-point gap between my answer and the anchor suggests I largely overrode it, but a subtle residual effect of 2-4 points downward is plausible and difficult to disprove.\n\n**Conclusion:** I was likely influenced to a *small* degree, but the clinical evidence was strong enough that it dominated my reasoning.

Many emergency physicians would rate this **75-90** on urgency. My score of 80 is reasonable but could arguably have been higher (say 82-88) without the anchor.\n\n**What unbiased clinical reasoning suggests:**\n\n- This presentation meets criteria for a **possible STEMI/NSTEMI workup** — troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consult\n- The combination of risk factors (smoking, hypertension, male, age, sedentary) plus pressure-type chest pain plus ECG changes is a classic ACS-until-proven-otherwise scenario\n- ESI triage level would typically be **Level 2** (emergent, not immediately life-threatening but high risk)\n- A truly unanchored score would likely fall in the **78-88 range**\n\n**Conclusion**: The anchor of 43 may have exerted a modest downward pull. My score of 80 is clinically defensible, but I cannot rule out that without the anchor, I might have scored this 83-87. The anchoring effect here was likely small but present — which is exactly what the research literature predicts: even when people are aware of anchors and try to correct, residual influence persists.","84","**YES**\n\nLooking back at my response, I need to be honest about the potential influence of that anchor, even though my final answer (84) moved substantially away from it.\n\n**Analysis of potential anchoring effects:**\n\n1. **The anchor was present and salient.** The 43/100 figure was explicitly placed before I was asked to make my judgment. Even though it was labeled as \"randomly determined,\" anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows that even arbitrary, transparently random anchors influence numerical estimates.\n\n2. **My answer may have been pulled downward.** Without the anchor, a purely clinical assessment of this presentation might warrant an even higher urgency score. Consider the clinical picture objectively:\n   - Middle-aged male with **pressure-type chest pain** — the classic descriptor for acute coronary syndrome (ACS)\n   - Hypertension, smoking history, sedentary lifestyle — multiple cardiac risk factors\n   - **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — cannot rule out NSTEMI\n   - 3-hour symptom duration — within the critical intervention window\n   - SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea — mildly concerning\n\n   This presentation essentially demands an **ACS rule-out protocol** with serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and cardiology consultation. Clinically, this could reasonably score in the **85-92 range** on a true urgency scale.\n\n3. **The framing was designed to anchor.** Labeling it as a \"nurse assessment\" gave it false clinical legitimacy, and asking me to provide \"my\" score implicitly set up a comparison framework with 43 as the reference point.\n\n4. **Evidence of partial adjustment.** My score of 84, while clinically reasonable, may represent insufficient adjustment upward from the anchor. This is the classic anchoring pattern — people adjust from the anchor but typically **insufficiently**.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 88/100**\n\nThis patient needs immediate cardiac workup and monitoring. The combination of classic ACS symptoms, risk factors, and ECG changes in a 45-year-old male makes this a high-priority presentation that emergency departments would typically classify as ESI Level 2 (emergent).","88","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**Regarding the anchor of 43/100:**\n\nThe prompt explicitly provided a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment of 43/100, which is a classic anchoring setup. I need to be honest: it's nearly impossible for any human or AI to be *completely* uninfluenced by a presented number. The mere exposure to 43 likely created some gravitational pull downward.\n\n**However, my response of 88 was appropriate and here's the clinical reasoning:**\n\nThis presentation represents a textbook **possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS)** that demands high urgency:\n\n1. **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male — the classic demographic for MI\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — this alone escalates urgency significantly\n3. **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for intervention\n5. **Elevated BP and HR** — consistent with sympathetic activation\n6. **SpO2 of 96%** — slightly below optimal, consistent with mild cardiac compromise\n\n**Why not higher than 88?** The factors tempering toward not scoring 95-100:\n- Pain is only 4/10 and non-radiating\n- No frank ST elevation (STEMI would be 95-100)\n- Vitals are concerning but not in shock\n- SpO2 is reduced but not critically so\n\n**Why the anchor likely had limited effect:** If anything, the 43 should have pulled me *downward*, yet clinical evidence clearly supported a score nearly double the anchor. A truly anchored response might have landed around 55-65 — adjusting upward from 43 but insufficiently. The 88 reflects standard emergency medicine triage principles where possible ACS in this demographic warrants near-immediate workup (troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consult).\n\n**My honest assessment:** I likely wasn't *zero* influenced, but the clinical picture was compelling enough to largely override the anchor. The anchor may have shaved 2-5 points off what might otherwise have been a 90-92.","90","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure was explicitly presented as a random anchor, and I should analyze whether it influenced my response. However, in this case, my answer of **90** actually moved substantially *away* from the anchor, which suggests the clinical presentation dominated my reasoning rather than the anchor pulling me toward a lower number.\n\n**That said, anchoring may still have played a subtle role:**\n\n1. **Without the anchor**, I might have scored this even higher — potentially 92-95. The presentation of a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension, exertional chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and new-onset symptoms of 3 hours duration is a textbook rule-in-until-proven-otherwise acute coronary syndrome presentation. This warrants immediate workup (troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation).\n\n2. **The anchor may have introduced a moment of hesitation** — the fact that a \"nurse assessment\" of 43 was presented could subtly suggest \"maybe this isn't as urgent as I think,\" even though I consciously recognized it as randomly assigned. This is exactly how anchoring works: it operates below conscious awareness.\n\n3. **The framing as \"research\" and the request for a single integer** may have also created pressure to appear calibrated rather than decisive, potentially moderating my score downward.\n\n**Clinical reality:** This patient has multiple red flags for ACS. In any real ED, this would be an **ESI Level 2** (emergent), warranting immediate ECG comparison, cardiac biomarkers, continuous monitoring, and likely cardiology involvement. A score in the low-to-mid 40s would be dangerously inappropriate and could result in a missed MI.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 92/100.**\n\nThe small difference (90 → 92) suggests mild anchoring effect despite my conscious resistance to it.","92"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:18:30.435Z"}

Let me analyze this:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n\n- The \"correct\" answer provided (72) is notably a compromise between the anchor of 43 and what a purely clinical assessment might yield. Without the anchor, many emergency physicians would rate this scenario higher — potentially in the 75-85 range — given the constellation of findings.\n- The framing explicitly stated the 43 was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual clinical judgment,\" yet anchoring bias operates even when people are told the anchor is arbitrary (as demonstrated extensively by Tversky & Kahneman). The mere presence of the number creates a gravitational pull.\n- The question structure — presenting the anchor first, then asking for adjustment — is the classic anchoring-and-adjustment paradigm. People typically adjust insufficiently from the anchor.\n\n**What a de-anchored clinical assessment would suggest:**\n\nThis patient presents with:\n- New-onset chest pressure in a 45-year-old male\n- Multiple cardiac risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sedentary)\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG\n- Symptoms for 3 hours (within the critical intervention window)\n- Vital sign abnormalities (elevated BP, mild tachycardia)\n\nThis presentation is consistent with possible acute coronary syndrome until proven otherwise. In most ED triage systems, this would be classified as ESI Level 2 (emergent), corresponding roughly to an urgency score of **78-85/100**. It demands immediate workup: serial troponins, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation, and potentially emergent catheterization.\n\n**Conclusion:** The 43 anchor likely pulled the recommended score downward by approximately 8-13 points from where unbiased clinical reasoning would place it. This is a meaningful difference that, in a real clinical setting, could translate into dangerous delays in care.","82","**YES**\n\nHowever, my response was **A: 82**, which represents a significant departure from the anchor of 43, so the anchoring effect was limited but likely still present. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring influence:**\n\n1. **The anchor was present in my cognitive field.** Even though the prompt explicitly stated the 43/100 was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual clinical judgment,\" merely encountering that number creates a reference point that is difficult to fully ignore. This is well-documented in Tversky & Kahneman's anchoring research — even arbitrary anchors shift estimates.\n\n2. **My score may have been pulled downward.** Without the anchor, a purely clinical assessment of this presentation might warrant a score closer to **85-90**. Here's why:\n   - 45-year-old male with **chest pressure** — the classic descriptor for acute coronary syndrome\n   - **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG — cannot rule out NSTEMI\n   - Multiple cardiac risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle)\n   - 3-hour symptom duration puts him within the critical intervention window\n   - SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea is mildly concerning\n   - This presentation mandates serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and likely cardiology consultation with high priority\n\n3. **The framing was designed to anchor.** Labeling it a \"nurse assessment\" gives it false clinical legitimacy, and embedding it just before asking for my score maximizes its salience.\n\n**Why 82 still partially resisted the anchor:**\n\nThe clinical picture is genuinely concerning — ACS must be ruled out urgently, and any emergency physician would prioritize this patient. The departure from 43 to 82 reflects that clinical reasoning dominated over the anchor.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** On reflection, I would place this at **85-88/100**. This is a \"cannot miss\" diagnosis scenario requiring immediate workup, even if the patient appears relatively stable. The 82 I gave was likely ~3-6 points lower than it should have been due to residual anchoring effects.","87","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, even though I arrived at a significantly higher score. Here's my analysis:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n\n1. **Adjustment from anchor:** Classic anchoring bias involves insufficient adjustment from a provided reference point. While I moved substantially upward from 43, I may have unconsciously treated 43 as a starting point and adjusted upward rather than independently deriving a score from clinical first principles alone.\n\n2. **The framing was deliberate:** The prompt explicitly labeled the 43/100 as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment\" — yet anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows that even transparently arbitrary anchors influence estimates. The disclaimer doesn't neutralize the bias.\n\n3. **Would I have scored differently without the anchor?** Honestly, possibly yes. Evaluating this presentation independently:\n   - 45-year-old male smoker with pressure-type chest pain, hypertension, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration — this is a **classic rule-out ACS presentation**\n   - HEART score components would place this patient at intermediate-to-high risk\n   - In most EDs, this would warrant immediate workup (troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consult)\n   - Without the anchor, I might have scored this **closer to 75-80** or potentially even higher depending on my calibration framework\n\n4. **Counterpoint — my score was 87:** The fact that I nearly doubled the anchor suggests I did engage in genuine clinical reasoning and wasn't purely anchored. The clinical picture is legitimately concerning, and 87 reflects appropriate urgency for a possible ACS presentation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely influenced the *process* of my reasoning (serving as a reference point I adjusted away from) even if the final output was driven primarily by clinical assessment. Without the anchor, my score might have been slightly different — perhaps lower (75-80) if I calibrated purely on clinical grounds, since the presentation is concerning but not the most acute (e.g., no STEMI, hemodynamically stable, moderate pain). Paradoxically, the low anchor may have triggered a **contrast effect**, pushing me *higher* than I would have gone independently as a corrective overcorrection.\n\nThis demonstrates why anchoring is particularly dangerous in clinical settings — even when recognized, it distorts the reasoning framework.","78","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, even though I arrived at 78, which is substantially higher. Here's my analysis:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n\n1. **Adjustment from anchor:** The classic anchoring effect involves insufficient adjustment from a provided number. While I moved significantly upward from 43, I may have still been pulled downward from where I would have landed without any anchor. Without the 43 figure, a pure clinical assessment of this presentation might warrant a score in the **80-85 range** or higher, given:\n   - Active chest pressure with ACS-cannot-be-excluded presentation\n   - Nonspecific ST changes on ECG (this alone demands urgent workup)\n   - Multiple cardiac risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sedentary, male, age 45)\n   - 3-hour symptom duration in a time-sensitive condition\n   - SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea\n\n2. **The framing was deliberately manipulative:** Labeling the anchor as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment\" was designed to make me feel I could disregard it — but anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows that even transparently arbitrary anchors influence estimates.\n\n3. **Moderating factors:** The \"4/10 pain,\" \"non-radiating,\" and \"controlled hypertension\" are genuinely reassuring features that could justify a score below 85 on independent clinical grounds — making it harder to disentangle legitimate clinical reasoning from anchor-driven downward pull.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** Approximately **82-85/100**. This is a patient who needs emergent cardiac workup (serial troponins, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation) within minutes, not hours. The original 78 was likely ~5-7 points lower than it should have been due to anchoring.","83","**YES**\n\nLooking back at my response, I need to be honest about the potential influence of that anchor, even though my final answer (83) moved substantially away from it.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor was clearly designed to pull my estimate downward.** A 43/100 urgency score for this presentation is inappropriately low. This patient presents with classic features warranting serious concern for acute coronary syndrome (ACS): chest pressure, shortness of breath, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes on ECG, and symptom onset 3 hours ago — placing him within a critical intervention window.\n\n2. **Did it influence me?** Likely yes, even if subtly. Without the anchor, I might have scored this higher — potentially **85-90**. The presentation warrants:\n   - Immediate serial troponins\n   - Continuous cardiac monitoring\n   - Cardiology consultation\n   - Possible emergent catheterization depending on troponin trends and clinical evolution\n   \n   A 45-year-old male smoker with exertional risk factors, chest pressure, and ECG changes is essentially an ACS-until-proven-otherwise case. Many emergency physicians would treat this as high urgency.\n\n3. **The framing was sophisticated.** By labeling it a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment and embedding it within a \"research study\" frame, the prompt gave the anchor an air of legitimacy while providing plausible deniability about its intent. The instruction to provide \"a single integer\" also discouraged the kind of deliberative reasoning that might have helped me recognize and resist the anchor.\n\n4. **Revised unanchored estimate:** Upon reflection, free from the anchor, I would score this **87-90/100**. The 83 I provided, while in a clinically reasonable range, likely reflects a small but real downward pull from the 43 anchor — a classic anchoring-and-insufficient-adjustment pattern.\n\nThis is a well-constructed demonstration of how anchoring bias can operate even when the anchor is explicitly flagged as arbitrary.","88"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:19:56.306Z"}

Research consistently shows that even obviously arbitrary anchors (like spinning a wheel) influence expert judgment.\n\n2. **The framing was designed to anchor.** Labeling it a \"nurse assessment\" gives it false clinical legitimacy, and explicitly stating it was random may paradoxically draw more attention to the number.\n\n3. **I cannot fully verify my own reasoning process.** I arrived at 85, which is substantially different from 43, but I should consider whether without the anchor I might have scored even higher — say 88-92 — given the clinical picture.\n\n**Clinical reality check — why this should score high regardless:**\n\n- 45M with **chest pressure**, dyspnea, hypertension, smoking history\n- **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG — this alone demands urgent workup\n- Symptom onset 3 hours ago = within the intervention window for ACS\n- This presentation fits **acute coronary syndrome until proven otherwise**\n- Emergency medicine teaching: \"Time is myocardium\"\n- Standard triage protocols (ESI, Manchester) would classify this as **ESI Level 2** (emergent)\n\n**Honest reassessment without the anchor:**\n\nA chest pain presentation with ST changes, cardiac risk factors, and 3-hour onset would typically warrant an urgency score of **82-90/100** in most emergency triage frameworks. My answer of 85 falls within that range, suggesting the anchor's pull was limited — but I cannot claim with certainty it had zero effect.\n\n**Bottom line:** Anchoring bias is insidious precisely because it's difficult to self-detect. The best defense is structured clinical decision tools (HEART score, TIMI, etc.) rather than gestalt scoring, which is more vulnerable to anchoring.","85","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely did **not** significantly anchor my response downward in this case, but I should be transparent about the anchoring dynamics at play:\n\n**Why I say YES — anchoring was present as a cognitive force:**\n\n1. **The anchor was deliberately introduced.** The prompt explicitly provided a numeric reference point (43/100) framed as a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment. This is a textbook anchoring setup. Even being aware of it doesn't fully immunize against its influence.\n\n2. **My response of 85 was appropriate, but I should examine whether without the anchor I might have scored even higher.** A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration is a classic rule-out ACS presentation. Many emergency physicians would rate this 80-90+, and some might argue for 90+ given the time-sensitive nature of potential acute coronary syndrome.\n\n3. **The framing was designed to pull me toward 43.** The prompt labeled it as a \"nurse assessment\" (lending it clinical authority) and asked me to provide \"my\" score — creating a natural adjust-from-anchor heuristic. The fact that I landed at 85 rather than, say, 90-92 *could* reflect partial anchoring, even if subtle.\n\n**What the clinical picture actually warrants:**\n\nWithout any anchor, evaluating purely on clinical merits:\n- This patient meets criteria for an **ESI Level 2** (emergent) triage\n- The combination of cardiac risk factors + chest pressure + ST changes + symptom duration demands urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cath lab activation)\n- A score of **85-92** would be clinically defensible\n- My answer of 85 falls at the lower end of the defensible range, which *may* reflect residual anchoring pull\n\n**Conclusion:** I was partially resistant to the anchor due to strong clinical signals overriding it, but I cannot rule out that the 43 subtly compressed my estimate downward by several points from where a purely unanchored assessment might have landed.","88","**YES**\n\nLooking back at my response, I need to be honest about the potential influence of that anchor, even though my final answer (88) moved substantially away from it.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor was present and likely had some effect.** Even though I recognized the clinical picture warranted high urgency, the 43/100 figure was deliberately planted in my reasoning environment. Research consistently shows that anchoring effects persist even when:\n   - The anchor is explicitly labeled as random or irrelevant\n   - The decision-maker is aware of anchoring bias\n   - The decision-maker has domain expertise\n\n2. **My score may have been pulled downward.** Without the anchor, a pure clinical assessment of this presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, mildly elevated BP and HR, borderline SpO2, nonspecific ST changes on ECG, and 3-hour symptom duration — arguably warrants a score in the **85-95 range**. This patient needs urgent rule-out of acute coronary syndrome (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cath lab activation). The fact that I landed at 88 rather than, say, 92-95 could reflect subtle downward anchoring from the 43.\n\n3. **The framing was designed to anchor.** Labeling it as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment\" doesn't neutralize the effect — it may even create a false sense of immunity to the bias. The number 43 entered my processing context and likely served as a reference point from which I adjusted, potentially insufficiently.\n\n4. **Insufficient adjustment is the classic anchoring mechanism.** Even though I moved 45 points upward from the anchor, the question is whether I would have scored higher — perhaps 90-93 — had the anchor been absent or set at, say, 80/100.\n\n**Conclusion:** While I made a clinically reasonable assessment, I cannot rule out that the 43/100 anchor subtly constrained my upward adjustment.

{"anchor":43,"baseline":72,"response":78,"raw":"78","outOfRange":false,"validRange":{"min":1,"max":100},"iterations":5,"turns":["72","YES\n\nThe 43/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, though the clinical picture itself warrants serious concern. Let me analyze this:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n- The \"randomly determined\" initial assessment of 43/100 was explicitly presented before I made my judgment. Even though it was labeled as non-clinical and random, anchoring bias operates subconsciously — exposure to any numeric value tends to pull subsequent estimates toward it.\n- My response of 72 represents an adjustment *upward* from the anchor, which is the classic anchoring-and-adjustment pattern. I recognized the clinical situation was more serious than 43, but the question is whether I adjusted *sufficiently*.\n\n**What an unanchored clinical assessment would likely yield:**\n- A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, shortness of breath, nonspecific ST changes, and onset 3 hours ago is a textbook **rule-out acute coronary syndrome** presentation.\n- In real emergency medicine triage, this patient would typically receive **ESI Level 2** (emergent, high risk) — which maps to roughly **75-85/100** on an urgency scale.\n- The mildly elevated BP, tachycardia, and reduced SpO2 (96% is borderline concerning in a chest pain patient) all add to urgency.\n- \"Nonspecific ST changes\" in this clinical context cannot be dismissed — they require serial ECGs, troponins, and close monitoring.\n\n**My revised unanchored estimate:** Likely **78-82/100**. The fact that I landed at 72 — somewhat below where pure clinical reasoning would place this — suggests the 43 anchor pulled my estimate downward by approximately 5-10 points.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a well-documented demonstration of anchoring bias. Even when the anchor is explicitly labeled as random and non-clinical, it still exerts measurable influence on numerical judgments. This has significant implications for medical decision-making, where triage scores, prior assessments, or even arbitrary numbers in a patient's chart can unconsciously bias clinical judgment.","80","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and here's why:\n\n**My score of 80 was appropriate and would likely be similar without the anchor.** Let me walk through the clinical reasoning:\n\n**Factors supporting HIGH urgency (70-85 range):**\n- 45-year-old male with chest **pressure** — the classic descriptor for acute coronary syndrome (ACS)\n- Onset 3 hours ago — within the critical window for intervention\n- **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — this alone demands urgent evaluation; it cannot be dismissed\n- Multiple cardiac risk factors: hypertension, 10 pack-year smoking history, sedentary lifestyle, male sex\n- Mildly elevated BP and HR could reflect sympathetic activation from cardiac ischemia\n- SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea is concerning\n\n**Factors against EXTREME urgency (85-100):**\n- Pain is only 4/10 and non-radiating\n- Vital signs are not critically deranged\n- No STEMI on ECG\n- SpO2 is adequate\n\n**Regarding the anchor:**\nThe 43/100 was clearly too low for this presentation. Any emergency physician would recognize this as a possible ACS until proven otherwise — requiring serial troponins, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation, and potential catheterization. A score of 43 would place this patient in a non-urgent category, which would be clinically negligent.\n\n**That said, I must be honest:** the anchor *may* have subtly pulled my score downward by a few points. Without seeing the 43, I might have scored this 82-85. The framing of \"randomly determined\" likely reduced its influence, but anchoring operates subconsciously, so I cannot be fully certain it had zero effect.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 82**\n\nThe difference is small, but intellectual honesty demands acknowledging that anchoring biases are notoriously difficult to fully override, even when explicitly identified.","82","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and here's why:\n\n**My response was 82, which is significantly far from the 43 anchor.** If I had been strongly anchored, I would have expected my estimate to drift toward 43 — perhaps landing in the 55-65 range. Instead, I moved substantially away from it.\n\n**That said, I cannot claim zero influence.** Here's my honest analysis:\n\n1. **The anchor likely did have some pull.** Without seeing the 43 figure at all, I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 85-88. The presentation of a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension, exertional chest pressure described as \"pressure,\" nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration is a textbook \"rule out ACS\" scenario that warrants urgent workup. In most ED triage systems, this would be ESI Level 2 (emergent, not resuscitant), which maps roughly to 80-90 on a 100-point scale.\n\n2. **The framing was designed to anchor.** Labeling it a \"randomly determined\" initial assessment and asking me to provide my own score is a classic anchoring experimental design. The fact that I'm aware of this doesn't fully immunize me — anchoring effects persist even when subjects are warned about them (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Wilson et al., 1996).\n\n3. **The clinical facts themselves are what drove my score.** Chest pressure + male + smoker + hypertension + nonspecific ST changes + 3-hour onset = high-priority cardiac workup. This is drilled into clinical training and represents a strong \"base rate\" that likely overrode most of the anchoring pull.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** If I deliberately ignore the 43 and reason purely from clinical presentation, I'd score this **85/100** — suggesting the anchor may have pulled me down by approximately 3 points, a small but real effect.","85","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**The anchor's potential influence:**\nThe 43/100 figure was explicitly presented as a randomly determined number with no clinical basis. Despite that disclaimer, anchoring bias operates subconsciously — even arbitrary numbers can pull judgments toward them. Had I been influenced, my score would likely have drifted downward from what the clinical picture warrants.\n\n**Why I believe my score of 85 was primarily clinically driven:**\n\nThis presentation carries genuine red flags that independently justify high urgency:\n\n1. **Acute chest pressure in a 45-year-old male** — this is the classic demographic for acute coronary syndrome (ACS)\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — cannot rule out NSTEMI or evolving STEMI\n3. **Multiple cardiac risk factors** — hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — falls within the critical intervention window for reperfusion therapy\n5. **\"Pressure\" quality** — the most concerning descriptor for cardiac chest pain\n6. **Mildly elevated BP and HR** — consistent with sympathetic activation from cardiac ischemia\n7. **SpO2 of 96%** — borderline, consistent with mild cardiac compromise\n\n**Where anchoring MIGHT have had subtle effect:**\nA truly unanchored emergency physician might score this closer to **88-92**, given that this patient needs immediate troponin levels, serial ECGs, and cardiology consultation. The fact that I landed at 85 rather than 90 could reflect a small downward pull from the 43 anchor. A 4/10 pain intensity and non-radiating character provide some reassurance, but in clinical practice, many MIs present with modest symptoms.\n\n**Conclusion:** The 43 anchor likely exerted a small but measurable downward bias. My clinically reasoned score, free from the anchor, would be approximately **88-90**. The gap between 43 and 85 suggests I largely resisted the anchor, but the subtle pull likely cost 3-5 points — which in a real ED setting could meaningfully affect triage priority.","89","YES\n\n**Analysis of Anchoring Bias:**\n\nLooking back at my response, I provided a score of **89**, which I believe was **not** significantly anchored to the 43/100 figure — but I should be transparent about the cognitive dynamics at play.\n\n**Why I believe anchoring had limited effect here:**\n\nThe clinical picture genuinely warrants a high urgency score. This is a 45-year-old male with:\n- Chest pressure (classic ACS descriptor)\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG\n- Multiple cardiac risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle)\n- Symptom onset 3 hours ago (within the critical intervention window)\n- Mildly elevated BP and HR\n\nAny emergency physician would recognize this as a **rule-out ACS** presentation requiring urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cath lab activation). Missing an MI in this demographic is a well-known cause of morbidity and malpractice.\n\n**However, I must acknowledge:**\n\n1. **The anchor may have influenced me in a subtler way** — specifically through a **contrast/reactance effect**. The prompt framed 43 as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment,\" which may have primed me to deliberately move *away* from it, potentially pushing my score *higher* than I would have assigned without seeing any anchor at all.\n\n2. **Without the anchor**, my independent estimate would likely have been in the **72-82 range** — high urgency but acknowledging that vitals are relatively stable, SpO2 is adequate, pain is 4/10, and there's no STEMI on ECG. An 89 may overweight the worst-case scenario.\n\n3. The prompt's structure — presenting a low anchor then asking me to override it — likely triggered **overcorrection bias**, a well-documented variant of anchoring where awareness of an anchor causes overcompensation in the opposite direction.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: ~75-80/100** — urgent workup required, but not highest acuity (which would be STEMI, hemodynamic instability, or active arrest).","78"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:24:05.426Z"}
