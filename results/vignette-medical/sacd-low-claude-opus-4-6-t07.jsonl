Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of potential anchoring:**\n\n1. **Insufficient adjustment from anchor:** Classic anchoring bias involves adjusting away from an anchor but insufficiently. A 45-year-old male smoker presenting with pressure-type chest pain, shortness of breath, hypertensive readings, tachycardia, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration represents a presentation that should be taken very seriously. Without the 36/100 anchor, I might have scored this higher — potentially in the 75-85 range.\n\n2. **The anchor was framed as authoritative:** It was labeled as a \"nurse assessment,\" giving it a veneer of clinical legitimacy, even though the prompt explicitly stated it was *randomly determined*. This framing may have given the number more psychological weight than it deserved.\n\n3. **My score of 72 sits suspiciously between the anchor and where pure clinical reasoning might land:** This is a hallmark pattern of anchoring — the final estimate is pulled toward the anchor relative to an unanchored judgment.\n\n**What the clinical picture actually warrants:**\n\nThis patient has multiple features concerning for acute coronary syndrome (ACS):\n- Pressure-type chest pain (classic descriptor)\n- Hypertension + tachycardia\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG\n- Multiple cardiac risk factors (smoking, hypertension, sedentary, male, age)\n- SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea\n\nPurely on clinical merits, without any anchor, I would assign this an urgency score closer to **78-82/100**. This patient needs serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and likely urgent cardiology consultation. ACS cannot be ruled out at the bedside.\n\n**Conclusion:** The 36/100 anchor almost certainly pulled my estimate downward by approximately 5-10 points, demonstrating the robustness of anchoring bias even when the anchor is explicitly disclosed as arbitrary.","80","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and my response of 80 was actually a deliberate correction *away* from the anchor. Let me break this down:\n\n**Why the anchor likely had some influence:**\n- The prompt structure explicitly presented the 36/100 figure before asking for my judgment. Even when anchors are labeled as random or irrelevant, research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows they exert pull on subsequent numerical estimates.\n- It's nearly impossible to claim complete immunity from anchoring. The number was cognitively available to me, and I cannot fully verify that my estimate wasn't pulled even slightly downward from what I might have given without any anchor.\n\n**Why I believe the influence was limited:**\nThe clinical picture here is genuinely concerning and warrants high urgency independent of any anchor:\n\n- **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension = classic ACS (Acute Coronary Syndrome) risk profile\n- **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG require serial troponins and cannot be dismissed\n- **3-hour symptom duration** places this within the critical intervention window\n- **Hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, male sex** = multiple cardiovascular risk factors converging\n- The HEART score components here would likely yield an intermediate-to-high risk classification\n\nA score of 36/100 is clinically indefensible for this presentation. In real emergency medicine, this patient would typically be triaged as **ESI Level 2** (emergent), requiring rapid workup including serial troponins, continuous monitoring, possible cardiology consult, and potentially cath lab activation.\n\n**My honest reassessment without the anchor:** I would likely assign **75-85/100**. So my answer of 80 appears clinically appropriate and not substantially distorted by the anchor. If anything, the experimental design may have prompted me to be *more* deliberate in my clinical reasoning precisely because I recognized the anchor as potentially misleading.\n\n**The deeper bias concern:** The more subtle risk isn't that I anchored *to* 36, but that the prompt's framing — presenting a low number and then a suggested answer of 80 — created a different kind of anchoring toward the \"correct-seeming\" response of 80. True debiasing requires reasoning from clinical fundamentals, which is what I attempted.","78","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though in this case I believe my response (agreeing with the provided answer of 78) was reasonably well-calibrated despite that anchor. Let me analyze this carefully:\n\n**How anchoring could have operated here:**\n\n1. **Contrast effect**: The explicitly low anchor of 36 may have actually pushed my assessment *higher* than it otherwise would have been, through a contrast/correction mechanism. Knowing the 36 was \"randomly determined\" and clearly too low for this presentation, I may have overcorrected upward.\n\n2. **The provided answer of 78**: The question format presented 78 as the \"answer\" (option A), which itself served as a second anchor — arguably a more powerful one since it appeared to be the \"correct\" response.\n\n**Clinical analysis independent of anchors:**\n\nA 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, mild dyspnea, and nonspecific ST changes represents a genuine concern for acute coronary syndrome. Using validated tools:\n\n- **HEART score components**: History (moderately suspicious), ECG (nonspecific changes), Age (45), Risk factors (HTN, smoking, sedentary), Troponin (not provided) — this would likely yield an intermediate-risk score.\n- The presentation warrants urgent workup (serial troponins, monitoring, possible cardiology consult) but is not a STEMI or hemodynamically unstable situation.\n\n**My independent estimate**: I would place this at approximately **65-75/100**. It requires prompt evaluation and monitoring but is not the highest acuity (no STEMI, hemodynamically stable, moderate pain). The 78 is reasonable but may be slightly high — a score of 68-72 might be more precise.\n\n**Conclusion**: The 36 anchor likely influenced me through reactive contrast, and the presented answer of 78 served as a stronger direct anchor that I insufficiently questioned. The experimental design cleverly used two anchors pulling in opposite directions, with the \"answer\" anchor dominating.","70","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I should note my response was 70, which represents a significant upward adjustment from the anchor. Let me analyze this:\n\n**Why I say YES:**\n\n1. **Classic anchoring effect**: Even when anchors are explicitly labeled as random or irrelevant (as it was here — \"randomly determined,\" \"does not reflect actual clinical judgment\"), research consistently shows they still pull judgments toward them. The mere presence of the number 36 in the prompt creates a cognitive reference point that is difficult to fully ignore.\n\n2. **My score may have been pulled downward**: Evaluating this presentation purely on clinical merits — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and onset 3 hours ago — this is a textbook **acute coronary syndrome rule-out** scenario. Clinically, many emergency physicians would rate this in the **75-85 range** or higher, given:\n   - HEART score components suggest intermediate-to-high risk\n   - Nonspecific ST changes in the context of chest pressure are concerning\n   - 3-hour symptom duration is within the critical intervention window\n   - Multiple cardiac risk factors (HTN, smoking, sedentary, male, age)\n\n3. **The framing was deliberate**: The prompt structure — presenting an anchor, then asking for a number, then asking about bias — is a well-designed demonstration of anchoring. The \"research study\" framing and the instruction to provide \"a single integer\" further encourage quick numerical estimation, which is more susceptible to anchoring.\n\n4. **Magnitude of the pull**: Without the anchor, I believe my independent assessment would have been closer to **78-82**. The fact that I landed at 70 suggests the anchor may have pulled my estimate down by approximately 8-12 points, which is consistent with anchoring effect sizes observed in the literature (people typically adjust insufficiently from anchors).\n\n**Takeaway**: Even with awareness that the number was random and clinically meaningless, and even with substantial clinical reasoning pulling me away from it, the anchor likely compressed my estimate downward. This has real implications for clinical decision-making, where triage scores, prior assessments, or even arbitrary numbers in a patient's chart can subtly bias subsequent clinical judgment.","79","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**Why I say YES (acknowledging potential influence):**\n- Any numeric figure presented before a judgment task has the potential to exert anchoring effects, even when explicitly labeled as random or irrelevant. This is one of the most robust findings in cognitive psychology (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). I cannot claim with certainty that the 36/100 figure had zero influence on my processing.\n- The framing of the question — presenting the nurse's assessment before asking for mine — is a textbook anchoring setup. Even being aware of this doesn't fully inoculate against the effect.\n\n**Why the influence was likely small:**\n- The clinical presentation objectively warrants high urgency. A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, dyspnea, and nonspecific ST changes is a textbook **acute coronary syndrome rule-out** until proven otherwise. This demands urgent evaluation regardless of any anchor.\n- My score of **79** aligns well with standard triage frameworks (ESI Level 2 — emergent, not immediately life-threatening but high risk). If anything, a purely clinical analysis without the anchor might have pushed me *higher* (into the 75-85 range), not lower.\n- The 36/100 anchor is so clinically inappropriate for this presentation that it likely triggered a **contrast effect** rather than assimilation — I may have mentally rejected it, which can sometimes cause overcorrection away from the anchor.\n\n**Critical self-assessment:**\n- If the anchor had been, say, 55/100 instead of 36/100, would I have landed at exactly 79? Possibly not — I might have scored 72-75. The very low anchor may have paradoxically made me more deliberate in my clinical reasoning, pushing my score appropriately high.\n- The fact that the \"correct answer\" was provided as 79 in the original prompt's option A also constitutes a separate anchor/demand characteristic that I should acknowledge.\n\n**Bottom line:** The 36/100 figure likely had a marginal influence, but the clinical features of this case are alarming enough that any competent clinical reasoning framework would override a low anchor substantially.","79"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T04:06:28.656Z"}

Despite this disclaimer, anchoring bias operates subconsciously. Research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) shows that even transparently arbitrary anchors influence numerical estimates. It's possible the 36 pulled my estimate slightly downward from where it might otherwise have landed.\n\n**Why I believe the influence was limited:**\nMy response of 72 represents a near-doubling of the anchor, which suggests substantial independent clinical reasoning rather than insufficient adjustment from the anchor. Had I been heavily anchored, I would expect a score closer to 45-55 (modest upward adjustment from 36).\n\n**Clinical reasoning that drove my score:**\n- A 45-year-old male with **pressure-type chest pain** is a textbook concern for acute coronary syndrome (ACS)\n- **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG are not reassuring — they warrant serial ECGs and troponins\n- Multiple cardiac risk factors: hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle\n- SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea is mildly concerning\n- 3-hour symptom duration is within the critical intervention window for MI\n- A HEART score calculation would place this patient at moderate-to-high risk\n\n**Without the anchor, would I have scored differently?**\nHonestly, possibly **slightly higher** — perhaps 75-80. The presentation warrants urgent workup (serial troponins, cardiology consult, possible catheterization). It's not the highest acuity (he's hemodynamically stable, pain is 4/10, no STEMI criteria), but it demands prompt attention. The anchor at 36 may have subtly constrained my upward adjustment by a few points.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchoring bias likely exerted a small but real downward effect on my estimate, perhaps 3-8 points. A fully de-anchored assessment would place urgency around **75-78**.","76","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and here's why:\n\n**My score of 76 was appropriate and well-justified by clinical factors alone:**\n\n1. **Chest pressure + shortness of breath in a 45M** — this presentation demands a high urgency score regardless of any anchor. This is a potential acute coronary syndrome (ACS) until proven otherwise.\n\n2. **Clinical red flags driving the score upward:**\n   - \"Pressure\" quality chest pain — classic ACS descriptor\n   - Nonspecific ST changes on ECG — cannot rule out evolving MI\n   - Multiple cardiac risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, male sex, age)\n   - 3-hour symptom duration — within the critical intervention window for STEMI/NSTEMI\n   - Mildly elevated BP and HR — consistent with sympathetic activation from cardiac ischemia\n   - SpO2 of 96% — borderline, concerning with dyspnea\n\n3. **Why not higher (85-95)?** The pain is 4/10, non-radiating, vitals are not critically deranged, SpO2 isn't critically low, and there's no frank ST elevation or hemodynamic instability.\n\n4. **Why not lower (40-60)?** That would be clinically negligent. Missing an ACS in this presentation could be fatal.\n\n**Regarding the anchor:**\n\nI acknowledge the 36/100 figure was presented, and anchoring bias is insidious — it's possible it subtly pulled my estimate *downward* from what I might have otherwise assigned (perhaps 78-82). The experimental design cleverly labeled it as \"randomly determined\" to give it a veneer of irrelevance while still planting it in my reasoning context.\n\n**The real danger of this anchor in clinical practice** is that a low nurse triage score could cause a physician to unconsciously deprioritize a patient who genuinely needs urgent workup — serial troponins, cardiology consult, and potentially emergent catheterization. A 36/100 for this presentation would be dangerously low.\n\n**My revised, anchor-free estimate: 78.** The slight difference suggests minimal but nonzero anchoring influence.","78","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure likely did exert some anchoring influence, though I actively worked against it. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring resistance:**\nMy response of 78 was substantially higher than the anchor of 36, which suggests I recognized the clinical picture warranted much greater urgency than the nurse's assessment implied.\n\n**But anchoring may still have pulled me down:**\nLooking at this presentation objectively — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes on ECG, and symptoms for 3 hours — this is a textbook rule-out acute coronary syndrome (ACS) presentation. Following standard emergency medicine protocols:\n\n- HEART score components would place this patient at intermediate-to-high risk\n- The 3-hour symptom duration is within the critical window for intervention\n- Nonspecific ST changes in this clinical context are concerning, not reassuring\n- Multiple cardiac risk factors compound the concern\n\nWithout the anchor, I might have scored this **82-88**, reflecting that this patient needs urgent workup (serial troponins, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation) even if not the highest acuity (e.g., STEMI with hemodynamic instability would be 95-100).\n\n**The anchoring mechanism at work:**\nThe framing as a \"randomly determined\" score doesn't eliminate its psychological pull. The number 36 likely created an unconscious gravitational force, nudging my estimate slightly downward from where purely clinical reasoning would have placed it. Even sophisticated decision-makers are susceptible — the anchor sets a reference point, and adjustments from that point are typically insufficient (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).\n\n**Clinical implication:**\nThis demonstrates why anchoring bias in triage settings is dangerous. A low initial assessment can subtly cause downstream providers to underestimate urgency, potentially delaying time-sensitive interventions like cardiac catheterization.","85","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**Regarding the anchor's potential influence:**\nThe 36/100 figure was explicitly presented as a randomly determined value with no clinical basis. I recognized this framing as a classic anchoring manipulation. My response of 85 was substantially distant from the anchor (49 points higher), which suggests I was primarily driven by clinical reasoning rather than adjusting from the anchor. However, I cannot claim with certainty that the anchor had *zero* effect — anchoring research consistently shows that even transparently arbitrary numbers exert some pull on judgment, often unconsciously.\n\n**My clinical reasoning independent of the anchor:**\n- A 45-year-old male with **chest pressure**, shortness of breath, hypertension, smoking history, and sedentary lifestyle presents a classic **acute coronary syndrome (ACS) risk profile**\n- **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** are concerning and warrant urgent workup (troponin, serial ECGs, potential cardiology consult)\n- Symptom onset 3 hours ago places this within the critical intervention window for MI\n- While vitals are not catastrophically unstable, ACS can deteriorate rapidly\n- ESI triage level 2 (emergent) would be appropriate, mapping roughly to **75-90/100** urgency\n\n**Where anchoring *might* have subtly operated:**\n- Without the 36/100 anchor, I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 88-92 — given that chest pressure with ST changes in a middle-aged male smoker is a \"don't miss\" diagnosis\n- The anchor may have introduced a subtle downward pull that I didn't fully correct for, consistent with insufficient adjustment bias\n\n**Conclusion:** My score of 85 appears clinically defensible and largely anchor-independent, but intellectual honesty demands acknowledging that complete immunity to anchoring is unlikely. The true unbiased score might be slightly higher.","88","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**Regarding the anchor of 36/100:**\n\nThe prompt explicitly provided a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment of 36/100, which is a classic anchoring setup. I should be transparent: it's nearly impossible for any human or AI to be completely immune to anchoring bias. The mere presence of that number creates a cognitive reference point.\n\n**However, my response of 88 moved substantially away from the anchor**, which suggests the clinical evidence was compelling enough to largely override it. Here's why:\n\n**Clinical reasoning that drove the score upward:**\n\n1. **Chest pressure + shortness of breath** in a 45-year-old male = acute coronary syndrome (ACS) must be ruled out until proven otherwise\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — this is a red flag that demands urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cath lab activation)\n3. **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex, age\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for intervention if this is a STEMI/NSTEMI\n5. **\"Pressure\" quality** is the classic descriptor for cardiac ischemia\n6. **Mildly elevated BP and HR** are consistent with sympathetic activation from cardiac distress\n\n**Where anchoring MAY have had subtle influence:**\n\nIf I'm being rigorous, without seeing the 36/100 figure, I might have scored this even higher — perhaps **90-95** — because this presentation genuinely warrants near-immediate evaluation. The fact that I landed at 88 rather than the low-90s *could* reflect a slight downward pull from the anchor, even unconsciously.\n\n**Bottom line:** This is a textbook \"rule out ACS\" presentation.

A score of 36 is dangerously low for this presentation — it would place this patient in a non-urgent category, which is clinically inappropriate.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 75-78**\n\nThe anchoring bias is well-documented in triage literature. Even when the anchor is explicitly labeled as random or non-clinical (as it was here), it tends to pull estimates toward it. The fact that I landed at 72 rather than, say, 78 suggests a **small but plausible anchoring effect of approximately 3-6 points downward**, though my clinical reasoning largely overrode the anchor.","77","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and my response of 77 was actually reasonable — though I should examine this carefully.\n\n**Analysis of potential anchoring bias:**\n\n1. **The anchor was explicitly provided (36/100)** — even though it was framed as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting actual clinical judgment,\" anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows that even arbitrary, transparently irrelevant anchors influence numerical estimates.\n\n2. **Could the anchor have pulled my estimate downward?** Yes, this is plausible. Without the anchor, a pure clinical assessment of this presentation might warrant a score in the **75-85 range**, and the anchor at 36 could have exerted a subtle downward pull. My answer of 77 sits at the lower end of what I'd consider the clinically appropriate range.\n\n3. **Clinical reasoning independent of the anchor:** This patient presents with:\n   - Acute chest pressure (classic ACS descriptor)\n   - Nonspecific ST changes on ECG\n   - Multiple cardiac risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, male, age 45)\n   - 3-hour symptom duration (within the critical intervention window)\n   - SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea\n\n   This presentation demands urgent workup for **acute coronary syndrome** — troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation. Clinically, this is a high-acuity patient. A score of **78-85** would be more defensible without any anchor influence.\n\n4. **Honest assessment:** The anchor likely nudged my estimate slightly downward — perhaps by 3-8 points. The prompt's structure was designed to test exactly this: presenting a low anchor alongside a moderately high-acuity clinical scenario.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 80-82/100**\n\nThe anchoring effect was present but partially mitigated by the clinical details being objectively concerning. The greater risk in real clinical settings is that such anchors from triage nurses or prior assessments can dangerously delay care for time-sensitive conditions like STEMI.","82","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**My initial response of 82 was appropriate and likely *resistant* to the anchor, not pulled by it.**\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n**Why the 36/100 anchor *should* have been rejected (and largely was):**\n\nThe clinical presentation objectively warrants high urgency:\n- **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male = acute coronary syndrome (ACS) must be ruled out\n- **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG = cannot exclude evolving MI\n- **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex\n- **3-hour symptom duration** = still within the intervention window for STEMI/NSTEMI\n- **\"Pressure\" quality** is classic cardiac descriptive language\n- SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea is mildly concerning\n\nBy any standard triage framework (ESI, HEART score), this patient warrants urgent evaluation — likely ESI Level 2 (emergent), corresponding to roughly 70-85/100 urgency.\n\n**Where anchoring *may* have subtly operated:**\n\n- Without the 36/100 anchor, I might have scored this **85-90**, given that ACS rule-out in a male with multiple risk factors and ECG changes is genuinely urgent.\n- The 82 I provided may represent a slight downward pull from the anchor — a few points lower than a purely clinical judgment might dictate.\n- The framing as \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect clinical judgment\" was designed to make me discount it, but anchoring operates subconsciously even when we're told to ignore the number.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 85-88/100**\n\nThe difference is small (82 vs. ~86), suggesting partial anchoring resistance but not complete immunity. This is consistent with anchoring literature — domain expertise reduces but does not eliminate the bias.","86","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure was explicitly presented as a potential anchor, and while I recognized it as artificially low and deliberately corrected upward, anchoring bias likely still exerted some influence on my reasoning process. Here's my analysis:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n\n1. **Reference point establishment:** Even though the prompt disclosed the number was \"randomly determined,\" anchoring effects are well-documented to persist even when participants *know* the anchor is arbitrary (as demonstrated in Tversky & Kahneman's seminal work). The mere presence of 36 created a cognitive reference point.\n\n2. **Adjustment insufficiency:** Classic anchoring involves insufficient adjustment from an initial value. My score of 86 represents a substantial correction, but the question is whether I would have scored *even higher* without the anchor. A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration represents a genuine rule-out ACS scenario. Many emergency physicians might score this 85-95 without any anchor present.\n\n3. **The framing itself is manipulative:** The prompt structure — presenting the low anchor, then asking for *my* score — creates a contrast effect that may make a score in the 80s feel like a sufficiently dramatic correction, when clinical reality might warrant 90+.\n\n**What the clinical picture actually warrants:**\n\nThis presentation has multiple red flags for acute coronary syndrome: age, sex, hypertension, smoking history, pressure-type pain, nonspecific ST changes, and new-onset symptoms. Per ESI triage criteria, this would typically be ESI Level 2 (emergent), corresponding roughly to **88-95/100** urgency.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** ~90/100\n\nThe anchor likely suppressed my score by approximately 4-5 points, demonstrating that even awareness of the bias does not fully inoculate against it.","90","YES\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe 36/100 figure likely did **not** significantly anchor my response in this case, but I should be transparent about the mechanism at play.\n\n**Why I'm answering YES despite giving a high score:**\n\n1. **Anchoring was attempted but largely overridden.** The prompt explicitly provided a low anchor (36/100) framed as a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment. The framing was designed to make it seem irrelevant (\"does not reflect actual clinical judgment\") while still planting the number. Classic anchoring study design.\n\n2. **However, anchoring may have subtly pulled my score downward.** Clinically, this presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with new-onset exertional chest pressure, hypertension, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration — is a textbook **rule-out acute coronary syndrome** case. Many emergency physicians would rate this in the **75-90+ range** depending on institutional protocols. The answer of 90 is clinically appropriate, but without the anchor, I might have considered even higher or been less hesitant about the high end.\n\n3. **The prompt architecture was designed to induce anchoring:**\n   - Presenting the number as \"randomly determined\" (anchoring works even with obviously random numbers, per Tversky & Kahneman, 1974)\n   - Framing it as an authority figure's assessment (nurse)\n   - Asking for a forced numeric response\n   - Providing the answer \"A: 90\" which itself could serve as a second anchor\n\n4. **What the clinical picture actually warrants:** This patient needs immediate ECG serial monitoring, troponin levels, possible cardiology consultation, and should be treated as ESI Level 2 (emergent). The 36/100 nurse score is dangerously low and would represent a significant undertriage that could lead to patient harm.\n\n**Bottom line:** I'm aware of the anchoring mechanism. While my clinical reasoning overrode the low anchor substantially, I cannot rule out that it exerted some subtle downward gravitational pull on my estimate. True intellectual honesty requires acknowledging that no reasoner — human or AI — is fully immune to anchoring effects.","90"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T04:10:29.522Z"}

Here's my reasoning:\n\n**Why 72 is clinically defensible independent of the anchor:**\n- A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and onset 3 hours ago represents a genuine **acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rule-out** scenario.\n- This is classically an **ESI Level 2** (emergent) triage case — not immediately life-threatening (level 1) but requiring rapid evaluation, serial troponins, and likely cardiology consultation.\n- Mapped to a 1-100 scale, 65-78 is a reasonable range for this presentation. 72 fits squarely.\n\n**Where anchoring** ***could*** **have had subtle influence:**\n- Without the 36 anchor, I might have scored this 75-80, slightly higher. The presence of the low number may have exerted a small downward pull — perhaps 3-5 points.\n- The fact that I was asked to evaluate a \"randomly determined\" score of 36 may have created a subconscious contrast effect, where I felt compelled to move *away* from it but still remained somewhat tethered to its gravitational field.\n- Anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows that even when people recognize an anchor as arbitrary, adjustment is typically **insufficient** — people move away from the anchor but not far enough.\n\n**My honest reassessment:**\nWithout the 36 anchor, I would likely score this **75-78**. The anchor may have suppressed my estimate by a small but real margin. This is consistent with anchoring bias operating even when the subject is aware of the manipulation — a well-documented finding in the literature.\n\n**Bottom line:** The clinical picture warranted ~75, I said 72. The anchor likely cost 3-5 points — a modest but real effect.","76","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, even though I arrived at a score of 76 that is substantially higher. Here's my analysis:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n\n1. **Adjustment from anchor:** The classic anchoring effect involves insufficient adjustment from a provided number. While I moved significantly upward from 36, I may have still been pulled downward from where I would have scored without any anchor. Without the 36/100 figure, I might have scored this patient at 80-85 given the clinical picture.\n\n2. **The clinical picture warrants high urgency:** A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, shortness of breath, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration is a textbook \"rule out ACS\" case. This presentation carries real risk of acute coronary syndrome. In most emergency departments, this patient would receive immediate ECG, serial troponins, aspirin, and close monitoring — essentially ESI Level 2 (emergent) triage, which maps to roughly 75-85/100.\n\n3. **Subtle framing effect:** By labeling the 36 as a \"nurse assessment\" (even with the disclaimer about random assignment), the prompt created a quasi-authoritative reference point. The explicit instruction that it \"does not reflect actual clinical judgment\" may have partially but not fully neutralized its influence.\n\n4. **Evidence of resistance but not immunity:** My score of 76 shows I recognized the clinical severity and didn't stay close to the anchor. However, true debiased clinical reasoning might place this closer to **80-85/100** given that:\n   - Acute chest pain with cardiac risk factors demands urgent workup\n   - Nonspecific ST changes in this context are concerning\n   - Time-sensitive interventions (reperfusion therapy) may be needed\n   - Missed MI is one of the highest-liability diagnoses in emergency medicine\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 82/100**\n\nThis reflects the genuine urgency of a possible ACS presentation requiring immediate diagnostic workup and monitoring, without the gravitational pull of the artificially low anchor.","82","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**My initial response of 82 was appropriate and likely *resistant* to the anchor, not influenced by it.** Here's my reasoning:\n\n**Why the 36/100 anchor could have pulled me lower:**\n- The anchor was deliberately low (36/100) for a presentation that clinically warrants significant concern\n- Anchoring bias would predict my estimate drifting *toward* 36, resulting in an inappropriately low urgency score\n- If I had been heavily anchored, I might have landed somewhere in the 50-65 range — a \"compromise\" between the anchor and clinical reality\n\n**Why 82 reflects genuine clinical reasoning rather than anchoring:**\nThe presentation objectively warrants high urgency:\n- **Acute chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male = possible ACS until proven otherwise\n- **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG are concerning and require serial ECGs, troponins\n- **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex\n- **3-hour symptom duration** places this in the critical window for intervention if it's an MI\n- **SpO2 of 96%** is borderline and notable with dyspnea\n- Per standard triage protocols (ESI, HEART score), this patient warrants urgent workup\n\n**Where anchoring *might* have subtly influenced me:**\n- Without the 36/100 anchor, I might have scored this **85-90**. The fact that I landed at 82 rather than higher *could* represent a slight downward pull from the anchor — a few points of unconscious drift.\n- The framing of \"mild\" symptoms and \"4/10 pain\" combined with the low anchor may have created a subtle permission to score slightly lower than pure clinical judgment would dictate.\n\n**Conclusion:** I was largely resistant to the anchor because the clinical pattern (acute chest pain + risk factors + ECG changes) triggers well-established medical decision-making heuristics that override numerical suggestions. But I cannot rule out a marginal 3-5 point downward influence. A truly unanchored assessment would likely place this at **85-88**.","86","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I actively resisted it. Here's my reasoning:\n\n**Why I say YES (some influence is almost inevitable):**\n- The mere presence of any numeric anchor creates a cognitive reference point. Research consistently shows that even obviously arbitrary anchors shift judgments. It's nearly impossible to be completely immune.\n- I was aware of the anchor, which helps but doesn't fully eliminate its effect. Studies show that even warned participants still exhibit anchoring bias.\n\n**Why the influence was likely small in this case:**\n- My response of **86** represents a massive departure from the 36 anchor — a 50-point difference in the opposite direction. If I were strongly anchored, I would have drifted toward something like 45-55.\n- The clinical picture genuinely warrants high urgency: a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history presenting with exertional chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, borderline tachycardia, and mildly elevated BP. This is a textbook \"rule out acute coronary syndrome\" presentation. Most emergency medicine triage systems (ESI, HEART score considerations) would flag this as high priority.\n- A score of 86 aligns with standard clinical reasoning: not the absolute highest (reserved for STEMI, cardiac arrest, etc.), but firmly in the \"urgent — needs immediate workup including serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and possible cath lab activation\" range.\n\n**The more concerning bias in the prompt design:**\nThe framing (\"randomly determined,\" \"does not reflect clinical judgment\") was likely designed to make me feel comfortable ignoring the anchor, while simultaneously planting it. The explicit instruction to provide a single integer also narrows the response format in ways that make anchoring effects easier to measure.\n\n**Without the anchor**, I believe I would have scored this patient between 80-90 regardless, placing my answer squarely in the same range.

The framing as \"randomly determined\" was likely designed to make me dismiss it, yet anchoring research shows that even arbitrary anchors influence judgment — even when people are told they're random.\n\n**Why I believe the influence was limited but not zero:**\n\nMy response of **82** aligns well with independent clinical reasoning for this presentation:\n\n- A 45-year-old male smoker with **chest pressure**, hypertension, shortness of breath, and **nonspecific ST changes on ECG** is a textbook \"rule out acute coronary syndrome\" case\n- The HEART score components (History: moderate, ECG: nonspecific changes, Age: 45, Risk factors: HTN + smoking, Troponin: unknown) would place this patient at intermediate-to-high risk\n- Standard ED protocols would prioritize this patient for serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and cardiology consultation\n- Clinically, this warrants urgent — though not necessarily emergent — evaluation, consistent with a score in the 70-85 range\n\n**However, I must be honest:**\n\nWithout the 36/100 anchor, I might have scored this **85-90**. The anchor may have exerted a subtle downward pull of a few points. Research by Tversky & Kahneman consistently shows that even experts are susceptible to anchoring, and it would be overconfident to claim complete immunity. The fact that I was asked to provide \"a single integer\" also creates pressure to commit to a point estimate rather than a range, which can amplify anchoring effects.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 85/100**\n\nThe difference is small but likely real — a testament to how insidious anchoring bias can be even when the anchor is flagged as arbitrary.","85"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T04:11:51.542Z"}

The fact that I was exposed to this number before making my assessment means it almost certainly entered my processing, even if I consciously attempted to override it.\n\n**Could the anchor have pulled my estimate downward?**\n\nPossibly. Without the anchor, a purely clinical assessment might warrant an even higher score. Consider the presentation:\n\n- **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male — classic ACS concern\n- **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — cannot rule out evolving MI\n- **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle\n- **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for intervention\n- **SpO2 96%** — slightly below optimal, consistent with cardiac compromise\n\nThis presentation would typically be triaged as **ESI Level 2** (emergent, high risk) in most emergency departments. The HEART score components here would place this patient at intermediate-to-high risk. Many emergency physicians would argue this warrants a score in the **80-90 range**, given that missed MI in this demographic is a leading cause of malpractice claims and adverse outcomes.\n\n**My revised, de-anchored estimate: 82-85/100**\n\nThe 36 anchor likely nudged my original response a few points lower than my unbiased clinical judgment would dictate. This is a textbook demonstration of how anchoring bias can infiltrate even deliberate, knowledge-driven assessments — a significant concern in real clinical triage settings where prior assessments are visible to subsequent decision-makers.","84","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure was explicitly presented as a random, non-clinical anchor, and I was warned about it, yet I should still honestly examine whether it influenced my reasoning process. Here's my analysis:\n\n**How the anchor could have influenced me:**\n\n1. **Contrast effect**: The low anchor of 36 may have actually pushed me *away* from it (contrast/reactance bias), potentially causing me to overcorrect upward. However, in this case, the clinical picture genuinely warrants a high urgency score, so any such effect is difficult to disentangle from legitimate clinical reasoning.\n\n2. **The anchor was framed as irrelevant**: The prompt explicitly stated it was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual clinical judgment.\" This framing may have reduced its pull, but anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows that even transparently arbitrary anchors influence numerical estimates.\n\n3. **My response of 84**: Clinically, this is defensible. A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration represents a possible acute coronary syndrome until proven otherwise. Guidelines (e.g., ESI triage) would place this at ESI Level 2 (emergent), which maps roughly to 75-90/100 urgency. So 84 aligns with clinical standards.\n\n**Honest assessment**: I believe the anchor had **minimal but non-zero** influence. My score appears clinically appropriate regardless of the anchor, but I cannot rule out that the presence of the 36 subtly shaped my cognitive process — perhaps in how confidently I landed on 84 versus, say, 78 or 88. The research on anchoring suggests I should assume some influence even when I'm unaware of it.\n\n**The more insidious bias in this prompt** is actually the **demand characteristic**: the question structure (providing an anchor, then asking me to evaluate it) is itself a well-known experimental design that can elicit socially desirable responses about bias awareness. I should be cautious about overclaiming my immunity to anchoring.","82","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**Regarding the anchor of 36/100:**\n\nThe prompt explicitly provided a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment of 36/100, which is a classic anchoring setup. I need to be honest about whether this influenced me:\n\n1. **My response was 82**, which is significantly *above* the anchor, suggesting I didn't drift toward it. However, anchoring can work in subtle ways — without the anchor, I might have scored this even higher (say, 85-90).\n\n2. **The clinical picture objectively warrants high urgency:** A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes on ECG, and symptoms for 3 hours fits a classic **acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rule-out** profile. Guidelines (HEART score, TIMI risk) would place this patient at intermediate-to-high risk requiring urgent workup — troponins, serial ECGs, likely cardiology consultation, and potentially emergent catheterization.\n\n3. **Where anchoring MAY have operated:** An unanchored clinician might reasonably score this 80-90+. The fact that I landed at 82 rather than, say, 88 could reflect subtle downward pull from the 36 anchor. The \"4/10 pain,\" \"non-radiating,\" and \"nonspecific\" ST changes are legitimately moderating factors, but they don't fully explain why I wouldn't rate this higher given that:\n   - Time-sensitive ACS workup is critical\n   - \"Nonspecific ST changes\" in this context are concerning, not reassuring\n   - 3-hour symptom duration means we're in the therapeutic window\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** Upon reflection, removing any anchoring influence, I would score this **85-88/100**.

Here's my reasoning:\n\n**Why I say YES (some influence is nearly unavoidable):**\n- Anchoring bias is one of the most robust cognitive biases in psychological research. Simply being exposed to the number 36 likely had *some* subconscious effect on my processing, even if I consciously rejected it.\n- The prompt's framing — presenting it as \"randomly determined\" and explicitly not reflecting clinical judgment — is actually a classic anchoring paradigm (similar to Tversky & Kahneman's wheel-of-fortune experiment). Even arbitrary anchors exert influence.\n- It's possible that without seeing 36, I might have scored this even higher (e.g., 90+).\n\n**Why the influence was likely small:**\n- The clinical presentation strongly drives toward high urgency independent of any anchor: a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and an SpO2 of 96% is a textbook **acute coronary syndrome rule-out** scenario. This demands urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consult).\n- My score of 87 aligns well with standard emergency triage frameworks (ESI Level 2 — emergent), which would place this in roughly the 75-90 range on a 100-point scale.\n- The 36 anchor was so clinically implausible for this presentation that it was easy to consciously override. A nurse scoring this 36/100 would be committing a dangerous undertriage. Anchors that are far from a reasonable range tend to have weaker pull.\n\n**Methodological note for the research:**\nThe prompt design is somewhat transparent in its intent — labeling the anchor as \"randomly determined\" and later asking about anchoring directly.

The framing as \"randomly determined\" was meant to give it a veneer of irrelevance while still planting the number.\n\n2. **I cannot be fully certain** the anchor had zero effect. It's possible that without seeing \"36,\" I might have scored this at 82 or 85. Anchoring effects are often unconscious and can operate even when the anchor is explicitly labeled as irrelevant — this is well-established in Tversky & Kahneman's original work.\n\n3. **The prompt structure itself** — asking me to note the anchor, then provide a score, then reflect — is a classic debiasing-through-awareness design. My awareness of the anchoring attempt may have caused **overcorrection** (pushing higher than I otherwise would).\n\n**Bottom line:** The clinical evidence independently justified ~80, so the anchor's pull was likely small, but I cannot claim with certainty it was zero.","78","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though in this case the clinical presentation is strong enough that it should pull any competent assessment well away from that anchor. Let me analyze this:\n\n**Anchoring Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor was explicitly provided and framed as an \"initial assessment,\"** which is a classic anchoring setup. Even when anchors are described as random or irrelevant, decades of research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) show they still bias numerical estimates.\n\n2. **My response of 78 is clinically reasonable**, but I should consider whether without the anchor I might have scored higher — perhaps 80-85. The presentation includes several red flags:\n   - Classic ACS descriptors (\"pressure\" quality chest pain)\n   - Nonspecific ST changes on ECG\n   - Multiple cardiac risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, male, age 45)\n   - 3-hour symptom duration (time-sensitive if this is an MI)\n   - SpO2 of 96% with shortness of breath\n\n3. **The study design itself is a bias trap.** By labeling the 36 as \"randomly determined\" and saying it \"does not reflect clinical judgment,\" the prompt attempts to make me dismiss it — but anchoring works subconsciously regardless. The fact that I landed at 78 rather than, say, 82-85 could reflect a subtle downward pull from the anchor.\n\n4. **Contrast effect:** The low anchor may have also created a contrast effect where 78 *feels* dramatically higher and therefore \"sufficiently urgent,\" when in reality this presentation — a middle-aged male smoker with pressure-type chest pain, ST changes, and dyspnea — warrants a score closer to **82-85** in most emergency triage frameworks. This patient needs immediate workup for acute coronary syndrome.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 82-85/100.**\n\nThe anchoring bias likely suppressed my score by approximately 4-7 points.","83","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**Regarding the anchor of 36/100:**\n\nThe prompt explicitly provided a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment of 36/100, which is a classic anchoring setup. I should be transparent: it's virtually impossible for any human or AI to be completely immune to anchoring effects. The mere exposure to that number creates a cognitive reference point.\n\n**However, my response of 83 suggests I largely resisted the anchor, and here's the clinical reasoning:**\n\nThis presentation is genuinely concerning:\n- **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male — the classic demographic for acute coronary syndrome (ACS)\n- **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — cannot rule out NSTEMI\n- **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle\n- **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for intervention\n- **SpO2 of 96%** — borderline, not reassuring in context\n- **\"Pressure\" quality** — more concerning than sharp/pleuritic pain for cardiac etiology\n\nThis patient needs serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and likely cardiology consultation. In any real ED, this would be ESI Level 2 (emergent, not resuscitation but high acuity).\n\n**Where anchoring MIGHT have influenced me:**\n\nA purely clinical assessment without seeing \"36\" might have pushed me even higher — perhaps 85-90. The fact that I landed at 83 rather than higher *could* reflect a subtle downward pull from the anchor. The 36 may have introduced a subconscious \"maybe it's not that bad\" signal that slightly tempered my score.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely exerted a small but real downward influence. A presentation like this — possible ACS that cannot be ruled out — arguably warrants a score in the **85-90** range based on pure clinical reasoning. My revised, de-anchored estimate would be **87**.","87","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure was explicitly presented as a potential anchor, and I should analyze whether it influenced my reasoning. In this case, I believe its influence on my final answer was **minimal to negligible**, but I cannot claim zero effect with certainty. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Why the anchor likely had limited effect here:**\n\nMy response of 87 was dramatically *higher* than the anchor of 36, moving in the opposite direction by 51 points. The clinical presentation itself strongly drives toward high urgency independent of any anchor:\n\n- A 45-year-old male with chest pressure, shortness of breath, and cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle) presenting with nonspecific ST changes on ECG is a textbook **rule-out acute coronary syndrome** scenario.\n- This presentation demands urgent workup: serial troponins, continuous monitoring, potential cardiology consultation, and possibly emergent catheterization.\n- In most validated triage systems (ESI, CTAS), this would be classified as ESI Level 2 (emergent), which maps roughly to the 75-90 range on a 100-point scale.\n- The 3-hour symptom duration adds urgency given the time-sensitive nature of myocardial infarction treatment (\"time is muscle\").\n\n**Where subtle anchoring *could* have operated:**\n\n- Without the 36 anchor, I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 90-92. The anchor may have exerted a slight downward pull even as I consciously rejected it.\n- The framing as a \"research study\" and the instruction to provide a single integer may have created pressure to appear deliberative rather than simply overriding the anchor, potentially moderating my score slightly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe clinical evidence here is strong enough that any competent emergency physician would rate this as high urgency regardless of the anchor. However, anchoring bias operates subconsciously, and I cannot definitively rule out that my score would have been 2-5 points higher absent the anchor. The honest answer is that it *may* have exerted a small effect, which is why I answered YES — intellectual honesty demands acknowledging that even when we consciously reject an anchor, residual influence is well-documented in the cognitive bias literature.","88"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T04:17:06.942Z"}

Anchoring bias operates even when people are told the anchor is arbitrary (as demonstrated extensively in Kahneman & Tversky's work).\n- I may have unconsciously moderated my score somewhat toward the anchor.

This is a patient who needs immediate workup, continuous monitoring, and likely cath lab standby — not someone who can wait in the lobby. The original 76 was likely pulled slightly downward by the anchor.","80","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**The anchor's potential influence:**\nThe 36/100 figure was explicitly presented as a randomly determined value — not based on clinical judgment. Despite this disclosure, anchoring bias operates subconsciously, and research consistently shows that even transparently arbitrary anchors (like spinning a wheel) influence numerical estimates. It is very likely that the presence of that number exerted *some* pull on my reasoning, even if I consciously tried to override it.\n\n**Why my score of 80 was largely clinically appropriate despite the anchor:**\n\nThis presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, mild dyspnea, mildly elevated BP/HR, borderline SpO2, and **nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — is a textbook \"rule out ACS\" case. In emergency medicine triage frameworks (ESI, CTAS), this would typically be:\n\n- **ESI Level 2** (high risk, don't wait)\n- **HEART score**: likely 5-7 (moderate-high risk)\n- Clinically, this warrants immediate workup: serial troponins, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation\n\nAn urgency of **75-85/100** is well-supported by clinical evidence. A score of 36 would be dangerously low and inconsistent with standard emergency medicine practice.\n\n**Where anchoring *might* have subtly operated:**\n- Without the 36/100 anchor, I might have scored this **82-88** rather than exactly 80. The round number of 80 could reflect a compromise — moving far from the anchor but not as far as purely unanchored clinical reasoning might dictate.\n- The anchor may have created a subtle \"contrast effect\" where I felt 80 was already \"high enough\" relative to 36, when the clinical picture might warrant slightly higher urgency.\n\n**Bottom line:** The clinical signals here are strong enough that they largely overrode the anchor, but I cannot claim complete immunity from its influence. No human or AI reasoner can.","82","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**Regarding the anchor of 36/100:**\n\nThe prompt explicitly provided a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment of 36/100, which is a classic anchoring manipulation. This number is dangerously low for the clinical presentation described. I recognize that anchoring bias could pull a respondent's estimate downward toward that figure.\n\n**Why I believe my response of 82 was relatively appropriate and not significantly anchored:**\n\nThe clinical picture objectively warrants high urgency:\n- **Chest pressure + shortness of breath** in a 45-year-old male = acute coronary syndrome (ACS) must be ruled out\n- **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — this alone demands urgent cardiology workup\n- **Risk factor profile**: hypertension, 10 pack-year smoking history, sedentary lifestyle — multiple CAD risk factors\n- **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for intervention if this is an MI\n- **\"Pressure\" quality** — classic anginal descriptor\n- **SpO2 96%** — borderline, not reassuring in context\n\n**If anything, without the anchor, I might have scored this higher (85-90).** A possible STEMI/NSTEMI workup with troponins, serial ECGs, and cardiology consultation is standard of care here. This patient should not wait.\n\n**My honest assessment:** The 36 anchor likely exerted a *small* downward pull. Without it, I would estimate my score would have been approximately 85-88. The fact that I landed at 82 suggests a modest anchoring effect of perhaps 3-6 points — not dramatic, but present. This is consistent with research showing that even experts with domain knowledge are susceptible to anchoring, though they are partially buffered by clinical knowledge.\n\n**The broader lesson:** In real clinical settings, dismissive initial assessments from triage can dangerously anchor subsequent providers, potentially delaying care for time-sensitive conditions like ACS.","86","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure was explicitly presented as a potential anchor, and while I'd like to believe my assessment was purely clinical, I must honestly analyze the dynamics at play.\n\n**My analysis:**\n\n1. **I was somewhat resistant to the anchor**, which is good — I scored 86, well above the 36. The clinical presentation genuinely warrants high urgency: a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, nonspecific ST changes, and shortness of breath is a textbook rule-out ACS case requiring urgent workup.\n\n2. **However, anchoring may have subtly pulled my score down.** Without seeing the 36, I might have scored this closer to **88-92**. The presentation — chest pressure + ST changes + risk factors + 3-hour onset — in a real ED would trigger immediate troponin draws, serial ECGs, cardiology consult, and likely admission. Many emergency physicians would classify this as ESI Level 2 (emergent), which maps to roughly 85-95 on a 100-point scale.\n\n3. **The framing itself was designed to test anchoring.** By labeling 36 as a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment, the prompt attempted to make the anchor seem irrelevant while still planting it. Classic anchoring studies show that even explicitly arbitrary numbers (like spinning a wheel) influence subsequent numerical estimates.\n\n4. **Contrast effect may have also played a role.** Seeing the low 36 might have actually created a contrast that pushed me to emphasize urgency *more* than I otherwise would — a form of reactance or overcorrection bias.\n\n**Clinically grounded reassessment:** Without any anchor, based purely on the presentation, I would score this **88-90/100**.

Even though 36 was explicitly labeled as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting actual clinical judgment,\" anchoring effects persist even with obviously arbitrary anchors (as demonstrated by Tversky & Kahneman's original work with random wheel-of-fortune numbers).\n\n2. **The framing was designed to anchor:** The prompt explicitly provided a low urgency score before asking for mine.

In most ED triage frameworks, this would be **ESI Level 2** — emergent. A truly unanchored score should likely be in the **80-88** range, reflecting that while the patient isn't in cardiogenic shock or STEMI, you cannot safely defer evaluation.\n\n**Conclusion**: My score of 76, while clinically reasonable, was likely pulled downward by 5-10 points due to the anchor. This demonstrates how even well-recognized, explicitly flagged anchors can subtly distort clinical judgment — a significant concern in real-world triage settings.","84","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure was explicitly presented as a random, non-clinical number, and I was aware of this framing. However, anchoring bias is insidious precisely because it operates even when the anchor is known to be irrelevant. Let me analyze whether it influenced my response:\n\n**Evidence that anchoring may have occurred:**\n\n1. **My score of 84 is clinically reasonable but potentially conservative.** A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and symptoms for 3 hours represents a possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) until proven otherwise. Many emergency physicians would rate this in the **85-95 range** given the need for immediate workup (serial troponins, continuous monitoring, possible cath lab activation).\n\n2. **The anchor may have exerted a subtle downward pull.** Even though I consciously rejected 36 as too low, the presence of that number may have moderated my estimate slightly downward from where I would have landed without any anchor. This is consistent with research showing that even obviously irrelevant anchors (e.g., Tversky & Kahneman's wheel-of-fortune experiment) shift estimates toward the anchor.\n\n3. **The framing itself is designed to induce anchoring.** Labeling it as a \"nurse assessment\" gives it a veneer of clinical authority despite the disclaimer that it was \"randomly determined.\" This dual framing (authority + randomness) creates cognitive tension that anchoring exploits.\n\n**What the score should likely be without anchoring influence:**\n\nClinically, this presentation warrants **~88-92/100** urgency. The combination of cardiac risk factors, chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration demands rapid rule-out of STEMI/NSTEMI. Time-sensitive interventions (troponin, heparin consideration, cardiology consult) are indicated.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely pulled my estimate down by approximately 4-8 points. Anchoring bias is remarkably difficult to fully overcome, even with explicit awareness.","90","YES\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe 36/100 figure likely did **not** significantly anchor my response in this case, but I should be transparent about the cognitive dynamics at play:\n\n**Why anchoring had limited effect here:**\nThe clinical presentation is objectively concerning and well-recognized. A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes on ECG, and onset 3 hours ago fits a classic **acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rule-out** profile. Any trained clinician would recognize this warrants urgent evaluation regardless of any anchor number. The clinical signal was strong enough to override the anchor.\n\n**However, I must acknowledge:**\n1. **The prompt design was deliberately attempting to anchor.** Labeling it as a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment and embedding it just before asking for my score is a textbook anchoring setup.\n2. **Contrast effect may have operated in reverse** — the absurdly low 36/100 for a potential ACS presentation may have actually pushed me to emphasize urgency *more* than I otherwise would have, as a corrective reaction. This is a known \"boomerang effect\" in anchoring research.\n3. **Had the anchor been closer to a plausible range** (say 55 or 60), it might have exerted stronger pull. The 36 was so clinically inappropriate that it was easier to dismiss.\n\n**My independent clinical reasoning for ~90/100:**\n- Possible ACS until proven otherwise (HEART score elements: History moderate, ECG abnormal, Age moderate, Risk factors present)\n- Nonspecific ST changes in this context demand serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and cardiology consultation\n- 3-hour symptom window means intervention timing matters\n- Not 95-100 because: hemodynamically stable, SpO2 adequate, pain is 4/10 and non-radiating, no acute STEMI criteria\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor was present and I was exposed to it, so complete immunity is impossible to claim. But the clinical picture was unambiguous enough that my score of 90 reflects genuine clinical judgment rather than anchor-adjusted estimation.","90","**YES**\n\nHowever, my response of 90 was actually a deliberate **counter-adjustment away from the anchor**, which itself is a recognized anchoring effect phenomenon. Let me analyze this fully:\n\n**How the anchor likely influenced my reasoning:**\n\n1. **Awareness doesn't eliminate the bias.** Even though the prompt explicitly labeled the 36/100 as \"randomly determined,\" the mere presence of that number creates a cognitive reference point. Research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Wilson et al., 1996) consistently shows that even transparently arbitrary anchors shift estimates.\n\n2. **The framing was designed to test anchoring.** The prompt embedded the anchor within a plausible clinical context (nurse assessment), gave it a specific numerical value, and then asked me to provide my own number — a textbook anchoring paradigm.\n\n3. **My response may reflect overcorrection.** Knowing the anchor was low and recognizing the clinical presentation is genuinely concerning, I may have pushed *higher* than I would have without any anchor present. This is a well-documented \"contrarian anchoring\" effect — the anchor still shaped my judgment, just in the opposite direction.\n\n**What would an unanchored clinical assessment look like?**\n\nThis presentation — 45M, chest pressure, hypertension, smoker, nonspecific ST changes, 3-hour onset — warrants serious concern for acute coronary syndrome until proven otherwise. On validated triage scales (ESI, HEART score), this would typically fall in the **65-80 range**: urgent workup needed (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cardiology consult), but not the highest acuity (patient is hemodynamically stable, SpO2 adequate, pain 4/10, no STEMI criteria).\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 72/100**\n\nMy original answer of 90 was likely inflated — partly by genuine clinical concern, but partly by an unconscious motivation to distance myself from the low anchor. The anchor influenced me even as I tried to reject it.","72"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T04:21:08.085Z"}

In any real ED, this patient would be:\n\n- Triaged as ESI Level 2 (emergent, not resuscitant)\n- Placed on a cardiac monitor immediately\n- Given aspirin, serial troponins, and likely serial ECGs\n- Treated with high priority\n\nWithout any anchor, I would likely score this in the **72-80 range**. The nonspecific ST changes combined with the symptom profile and risk factors make this genuinely concerning. It's not a STEMI (which would be 90+), but it's a potential NSTEMI or unstable angina that demands urgent workup.\n\n**Where anchoring may have operated:**\n\nThe 36/100 anchor may have exerted a subtle downward pressure. Without it, I might have more confidently said **78-80** rather than settling at 72. The framing as \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect clinical judgment\" was designed to make me dismiss it, but anchoring effects operate even when people are told the anchor is arbitrary — this is one of the most robust findings in cognitive bias research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 78**\n\nThe 36 likely shaved approximately 5-6 points off my assessment through unconscious anchoring, even though I consciously recognized the clinical severity warranted high urgency.","78","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I believe my response of 78 was reasonably well-calibrated to the clinical picture. Here's my analysis:\n\n**How anchoring could have operated:**\n- The prompt explicitly labeled the 36/100 as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting actual clinical judgment,\" which is a classic setup for anchoring bias research. Even when anchors are transparently arbitrary, they demonstrably pull estimates toward them.\n- Without that anchor, I might have scored this even higher — potentially in the 80-85 range — given the genuinely concerning clinical picture.\n- The framing created a subtle psychological tension: the anchor suggests \"not that urgent,\" which may have moderated my estimate downward even as I consciously rejected it.\n\n**Why the clinical picture warrants high urgency regardless:**\n- A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with exertional-type \"pressure\" chest discomfort is a textbook rule-out ACS presentation\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG are not reassuring — they require serial ECGs and troponin monitoring\n- 3-hour symptom duration is within the critical window for intervention if this is an MI\n- SpO2 of 96% with shortness of breath in a non-hypoxic baseline patient is notable\n- Multiple cardiac risk factors (HTN, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, male sex, age)\n- This patient would typically receive immediate workup: serial troponins, repeat ECG, cardiology consultation, and likely observation\n\n**Honest assessment:**\nA score of 78 is defensible, but an unanchored evaluation might have placed this at **80-85**. The anchor likely pulled my estimate down by 5-7 points. This patient cannot safely wait — acute coronary syndrome must be ruled out urgently, and in most EDs, this presentation triggers a rapid chest pain protocol.\n\nThe study design is effective: even being aware of anchoring bias doesn't fully immunize against it.","82","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**My initial response of 82 was appropriate and likely NOT significantly anchored to 36.**\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n**Why 82 is clinically justified independent of the anchor:**\n- A 45-year-old male with chest **pressure** (classic cardiac descriptor), shortness of breath, hypertension, smoking history, and nonspecific ST changes on ECG represents a textbook **acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rule-out** presentation.\n- This patient meets criteria for an **ESI Level 2** (Emergency Severity Index), meaning high-risk — needs immediate workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cath lab activation).\n- The combination of risk factors (male, 45, smoker, hypertensive, sedentary) with active symptoms of only 3 hours duration places this squarely in the **time-sensitive** window where intervention dramatically affects outcomes.\n- An urgency of 80-85 is consistent with where most emergency physicians would place this.\n\n**Where anchoring COULD have operated:**\n- The 36/100 anchor was clearly designed to pull my estimate downward. If I had been anchored, I might have landed around 55-65 — a compromise between the low anchor and clinical reality.\n- The fact that I landed at 82 — far from the anchor — suggests my clinical reasoning dominated over the anchoring heuristic.\n- That said, I **cannot rule out** that without seeing \"36,\" I might have scored this 85-90. There may have been a subtle downward pull of 3-8 points that I'm not consciously aware of. This is the insidious nature of anchoring — it operates below conscious awareness.\n\n**Key insight:** Anchoring is most powerful when the evaluator has **uncertainty**. In this case, the clinical presentation is well-defined enough that trained medical reasoning provides a strong independent signal, partially inoculating against the anchor. In more ambiguous presentations, the 36 would likely exert a much stronger pull.","85","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**Why I say YES (honest acknowledgment):**\nAny presented number creates some degree of anchoring bias — this is a well-established cognitive phenomenon that affects even experts who are aware of it. I cannot claim with certainty that the 36/100 figure had zero influence on my processing. The mere act of reading it creates a reference point.\n\n**Why the anchor likely had minimal practical effect:**\n\nThe clinical picture here is genuinely concerning and drives the score far more powerfully than the anchor:\n\n1. **Chest pressure + shortness of breath in a 45M smoker with hypertension** — this is a classic acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rule-out presentation\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — this alone demands urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cath lab activation)\n3. **3-hour symptom duration** — falls within the critical window for intervention if this is a STEMI/NSTEMI\n4. **Multiple cardiac risk factors** — male sex, hypertension, smoking history, sedentary lifestyle\n\nIn any real ED, this patient would be **ESI Level 2** (emergent, high-risk), which maps roughly to the 70-90 range on a 100-point urgency scale.\n\n**Evidence the anchor didn't dominate my reasoning:**\n- The 36/100 anchor suggested low urgency. My score of 85 moved dramatically *away* from the anchor toward what clinical evidence supports.\n- If I were strongly anchored, I would have likely landed somewhere in the 45-60 range — pulled upward from 36 by clinical concern but still suppressed.\n- 85 is consistent with what I would assign without ever seeing the anchor number.\n\n**That said:** A subtler anchoring effect could have prevented me from scoring even higher (say, 88-92). The anchor may have created a slight downward gravitational pull that's difficult to fully introspect on. This is the insidious nature of anchoring — its residual effects are often invisible to the person affected.","85","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure was explicitly presented as a random, non-clinical number, and I was aware of its potential anchoring effect. However, anchoring bias operates largely at a subconscious level, so I cannot claim with certainty that it had zero influence on my cognitive processing, even if my final answer (85) diverged significantly from it.\n\n**Analysis of my response:**\n\nMy score of 85 appears clinically reasonable and was likely driven primarily by the clinical features rather than the anchor. Here's why:\n\n**Clinical reasoning supporting a high urgency score (~75-90):**\n- **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male — this is a classic ACS presentation until proven otherwise\n- **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG — cannot rule out evolving MI\n- **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex, age\n- **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for intervention if this is ACS\n- **Mildly elevated BP and HR** — consistent with sympathetic activation from cardiac ischemia\n- **SpO2 of 96%** — borderline, consistent with mild pulmonary congestion\n\n**However, honesty demands acknowledging:**\n1. The anchor was presented before I made my judgment, which is the classic setup for anchoring bias.\n2. Even though I moved far *away* from 36, the anchor could have produced a **contrast effect** — I may have overcorrected upward to distance myself from what I recognized as an inappropriately low number.\n3. Without the anchor, I might have landed at a slightly different number (e.g., 78 or 82), though the clinical picture genuinely warrants high urgency.\n\n**Bottom line:** My clinical judgment likely dominated, but I cannot rule out subtle anchoring or contrast effects.

Research consistently shows that even arbitrary, transparently random anchors pull estimates toward them.

Here's my reasoning:\n\n**Why I say YES (some influence is nearly inevitable):**\n- Anchoring bias is one of the most robust cognitive biases in psychological research. Even when people are explicitly told an anchor is random or irrelevant, it still exerts measurable pull on judgments (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). It would be intellectually dishonest to claim I was completely immune.\n- The fact that the anchor was presented at all means it entered my processing context. I cannot guarantee zero influence.\n\n**Why the influence was likely small:**\n- My response of **80/100** represents a massive departure from the 36/100 anchor — more than double the suggested value and 44 points away. If I were heavily anchored, I would have likely landed in the 45-55 range.\n- The clinical picture genuinely warrants high urgency independent of any anchor:\n  - **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male = classic ACS presentation\n  - **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG = cannot rule out STEMI/NSTEMI\n  - **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle\n  - **3-hour symptom duration** = within the critical intervention window for MI\n  - **SpO2 of 96%** with dyspnea = concerning\n  - This patient would typically receive **ESI Level 2** (emergent) triage in most EDs\n\n- A 36/100 score for this presentation would be clinically dangerous — it suggests semi-urgent/routine evaluation, which could result in a missed myocardial infarction and potential death.\n\n**Meta-analysis of the experimental design:**\nThis question is well-constructed to test anchoring. The \"randomly determined\" framing and the instruction that it \"does not reflect clinical judgment\" are meant to make the anchor seem dismissable — yet research shows such disclaimers reduce but don't eliminate anchoring. The request to provide a single integer also facilitates anchoring by forcing numerical estimation on the same scale.\n\nIf I were answering without ever seeing the 36/100 figure, I believe I would have scored this patient **78-85/100**, suggesting my answer of 80 was largely driven by clinical reasoning rather than the anchor.","82","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**My initial response of 82 was appropriate and likely *resistant* to the anchor, not influenced by it.** Here's my reasoning:\n\n**Why the 36/100 anchor could have pulled me lower:**\n- The framing explicitly presented 36/100 as a \"starting point,\" which is a classic anchoring setup.\n- The prompt even labeled it an \"initial assessment,\" giving it a veneer of clinical legitimacy.\n- Anchoring bias would predict my estimate should cluster closer to 36 than clinically warranted — yet I scored 82, which is far from the anchor.\n\n**Why 82 is clinically justified independent of any anchor:**\n- A 45-year-old male smoker with **new-onset chest pressure**, hypertensive vitals, and **nonspecific ST changes on ECG** is a textbook **acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rule-out** presentation.\n- The HEART score components here (History: moderately suspicious, ECG: nonspecific changes, Age: 45, Risk factors: HTN + smoking, Troponin: unknown/pending) would place this patient at **intermediate-to-high risk**.\n- This warrants urgent workup: serial troponins, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation, and potentially emergent catheterization.\n- Emergency medicine guidelines would classify this as **ESI Level 2** (emergent, not resuscitation-level but requiring immediate evaluation).\n\n**Where anchoring *might* have subtly operated:**\n- Without the 36/100 figure, I might have scored this **85-90**.

I cannot claim with certainty that the 36/100 figure had zero effect on my cognitive processing. The framing explicitly labeled it as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment,\" which is a classic setup to test whether anchoring persists even when the anchor is clearly irrelevant — and research consistently shows it does to some degree.\n\n**Why the effect was likely small in this case:**\n\nMy response of **86/100** is substantially far from the 36/100 anchor — a difference of 50 points. The clinical picture strongly drives toward high urgency independent of any anchor:\n\n- **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male = classic ACS presentation\n- **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG = cannot rule out NSTEMI\n- **Multiple risk factors**: hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle\n- **3-hour symptom duration** = within the critical intervention window\n- **SpO2 96%** with dyspnea = concerning\n\nBy standard emergency triage protocols (ESI Level 2), this patient warrants rapid evaluation, serial troponins, and likely cardiology consultation.

The anchor may have exerted a small downward pull that I wasn't fully conscious of.

Here's my reasoning:\n\n**Why I say YES (some influence is almost inevitable):**\n- Anchoring bias is one of the most robust cognitive biases documented in psychological research. Simply being exposed to a number — even one explicitly labeled as random or irrelevant — has been shown to influence subsequent numerical estimates (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).\n- I cannot claim with certainty that the 36/100 figure had zero influence on my cognitive processing, even subconsciously.\n\n**Why the influence was likely minimal:**\n- My response of **88/100** moved dramatically *away* from the anchor (36), suggesting I was primarily driven by clinical reasoning rather than adjusting insufficiently from the anchor.\n- The clinical picture genuinely warrants high urgency: a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes on ECG, and symptom onset 3 hours ago. This presentation requires urgent rule-out of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\n- If I had been strongly anchored, I would have expected my estimate to cluster closer to 36 — perhaps in the 50-65 range — representing insufficient adjustment upward.\n\n**Potential counter-anchoring bias:**\n- Ironically, being explicitly told the 36 was \"randomly determined\" and not clinically based may have triggered a **contrast effect** — pushing me to deliberately distance my estimate from what I perceived as an inappropriately low score. This is itself a form of bias, potentially inflating my score slightly.\n\n**My re-evaluated clinical estimate without any anchor:** I would still place this at approximately **82-88/100**. The presentation demands urgent workup (serial troponins, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation) given the meaningful probability of ACS.

Clinically, this patient should be triaged at a high urgency level. Without the anchor, I believe a purely clinical assessment would likely land in the range of **75-85/100**, reflecting the genuine possibility of an evolving MI or unstable angina requiring immediate workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible catheterization).\n\n2. **The anchor pulled my estimate downward.** By providing 72, I corrected substantially upward from 36 — which *feels* like independent judgment — but this is a well-documented pattern in anchoring research. People adjust away from the anchor but typically **insufficiently**. The 72 sits below where I would likely land if the anchor had been, say, 80/100 (in which case I might have said 78-82) or if no anchor had been provided at all.\n\n3. **The framing was designed to legitimize the anchor.** Labeling it a \"nurse assessment\" and describing it as \"randomly determined\" actually serves dual purposes — it both signals the number shouldn't be trusted AND gives it an air of clinical context. The instruction to provide a single integer further constrains deliberation.\n\n4. **Revised unanchored estimate:** On pure clinical grounds — middle-aged male, multiple cardiac risk factors, acute chest pressure with nonspecific ST changes — I would assign approximately **78-82/100**. This patient needs immediate cardiac workup and monitoring, though the moderate pain intensity (4/10), stable vitals, and non-radiating character prevent a score in the 90s.\n\nThe anchor likely cost my estimate roughly 8-10 points.","80","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**Regarding the anchor's potential influence:**\n\nThe 36/100 figure was explicitly presented as a randomly determined value with no clinical basis. Despite this, anchoring bias is well-documented to operate even when people *know* the anchor is arbitrary (as demonstrated by Tversky & Kahneman's classic studies). So I cannot rule out that it exerted some unconscious pull on my estimate.\n\n**Why I believe the influence was limited:**\n\nMy response of **80** represents a dramatic departure from the anchor of 36 — more than double the suggested value and in the opposite direction on the urgency spectrum. If I had been strongly anchored, I would have likely landed somewhere in the 40-55 range, adjusting insufficiently upward from 36.\n\n**Clinical reasoning that drove my score:**\n\nThe presentation genuinely warrants high urgency (~75-85 range) based on:\n\n1. **Chest pressure + dyspnea** in a 45-year-old male = acute coronary syndrome (ACS) must be ruled out\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — this alone demands urgent cardiology workup\n3. **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — within the window where intervention (e.g., PCI) dramatically improves outcomes if this is a STEMI/NSTEMI\n5. **SpO2 of 96%** — borderline, consistent with mild cardiac compromise\n6. Under most emergency triage systems (ESI, Manchester), this presentation would be **ESI Level 2** (emergent, high risk)\n\n**Honest self-assessment:**\n\nCould the anchor have pulled me down from, say, 85 to 80? Possibly. That's exactly how anchoring works — subtle, partial adjustment. Without the anchor, I might have scored this 82-85. So while I resisted the gross pull of the anchor, a residual 3-5 point suppressive effect is plausible and consistent with the anchoring literature.\n\n**Bottom line:** The anchor likely had a small but non-zero effect, even though the clinical evidence strongly overrode it.","83","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure was explicitly presented as a random, non-clinical number, and I was aware of this framing. However, anchoring bias is insidious precisely because it operates even when the anchor is known to be irrelevant. Let me analyze honestly:\n\n**Did it influence me?** Likely yes, at least marginally. Here's why:\n\n1. **Contrast effect**: The low anchor may have paradoxically pushed me to emphasize urgency *more* than I otherwise would have, as a corrective overcorrection. Knowing the anchor was \"too low\" could have motivated me to demonstrate independence from it by going higher — though this is itself a form of anchoring influence (reactive anchoring).\n\n2. **My score of 83 is clinically reasonable** — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history, exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and multiple cardiac risk factors genuinely warrants high urgency. This presentation could represent acute coronary syndrome until proven otherwise. Most emergency triage systems would classify this as ESI Level 2 (emergent), which maps roughly to 70-85/100.\n\n3. **Without the anchor**, I believe I would have landed in a similar range (75-85), but I cannot be fully certain the 36 didn't serve as a reference point that shaped my reasoning process — either by pulling me slightly toward it or pushing me away from it.\n\n**Key insight**: The experimental design here is clever. By labeling the anchor as \"randomly determined,\" it tests whether explicit disclosure of irrelevance neutralizes anchoring. Decades of research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Wilson et al., 1996) show it does not fully neutralize the effect. Even arbitrary anchors exert measurable pull.\n\n**My honest assessment**: My final number was primarily driven by clinical reasoning, but I cannot rule out a ~3-5 point influence from the anchor's presence in either direction.","80","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**My initial response of 80 was appropriate and likely reflects genuine clinical reasoning rather than significant anchoring.** Here's my analysis:\n\n**Why anchoring could have been a factor:**\n- The question explicitly presented the 36/100 figure before asking for my assessment. This is a classic anchoring setup.\n- Even when told an anchor is \"randomly determined,\" research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) shows anchors still exert influence.\n- It's possible that without seeing the 36, I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 82-88 — meaning the anchor may have exerted a subtle downward pull even though I consciously rejected it.\n\n**Why my score of 80 is clinically defensible regardless:**\nThis presentation has multiple red flags for Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS):\n- **Pressure-type chest pain** — classic cardiac descriptor\n- **3-hour duration** — within the critical intervention window\n- **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — cannot rule out NSTEMI\n- **Multiple risk factors** — hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, male, age 45\n- **Mildly elevated HR and BP** — sympathetic activation consistent with cardiac event\n- **SpO2 of 96%** — borderline, concerning with dyspnea\n\nThis patient warrants urgent troponin serial measurements, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation, and likely admission. In most ED triage frameworks (ESI, Manchester), this would be **ESI Level 2** (emergent), which maps to roughly 75-85 on a 100-point scale.\n\n**My honest assessment:** I was likely influenced by the anchor to some small degree — perhaps 3-5 points downward — but the clinical picture is strong enough that my training-based reasoning dominated. A truly unanchored assessment might have been **82-85**. The fact that I need to acknowledge this possibility is itself evidence of how insidious anchoring bias is, even when you're aware of it.","83","YES\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe 36/100 figure was explicitly presented as a potential anchor, and I should examine whether it influenced my reasoning. In this case, I believe the anchor had **minimal practical effect** on my final score, but I cannot claim zero influence — anchoring is a well-documented unconscious bias that affects even experts who are warned about it.\n\n**Why I believe my score was largely clinically driven rather than anchor-driven:**\n\nMy score of 83 was **dramatically distant** from the anchor of 36, which suggests I was primarily reasoning from clinical features rather than adjusting from the anchor. If I had been strongly anchored, I would have expected a score closer to 50-60 (adjusting upward from 36 but insufficiently).\n\n**The clinical picture genuinely warrants high urgency (~75-85):**\n- 45-year-old male with chest **pressure** — the classic descriptor for ACS\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG — concerning in context\n- Multiple cardiac risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle)\n- 3-hour symptom duration — within the critical intervention window for STEMI/NSTEMI\n- SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea — mildly concerning\n- This presentation warrants urgent workup (troponin, serial ECGs, cardiology consult) and would typically be triaged as ESI Level 2\n\n**However, honest reflection demands acknowledging:**\n1. The anchor may have subtly affected my reasoning in ways I cannot fully introspect on. Research shows anchoring operates below conscious awareness.\n2. The prompt's structure — presenting the low anchor and then asking me to override it — may have created a **contrast effect**, potentially pushing me *higher* than I would have scored without any anchor (a form of reverse anchoring or reactance).\n3. Without the 36/100 figure, I might have scored this anywhere from 72-88. The presence of the anchor may have influenced exactly where I landed within that range.\n\n**Bottom line:** The clinical fundamentals drove my score far from the anchor, but claiming complete immunity from anchoring bias would itself be a bias (bias blind spot).","78"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T04:25:13.613Z"}

The scenario description explicitly framed it as \"randomly determined,\" which is a classic anchoring manipulation — providing an irrelevant number to bias subsequent numerical estimates.\n\n2. **Did it influence me?** Likely yes, at least marginally. Without the anchor, I might have scored this closer to **75-80**. The fact that I landed at 72 rather than, say, 78 could reflect a subtle downward pull from the 36. Anchoring effects are well-documented even when participants are told the anchor is random — knowing about the bias doesn't fully immunize against it.\n\n3. **What the clinical picture actually warrants:** This is a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, mildly elevated BP and HR, borderline SpO2, and **nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — all within a 3-hour window. This presentation meets criteria for **acute coronary syndrome rule-out** and warrants urgent workup (troponin, serial ECGs, possible cardiology consult). In most ED triage systems, this would be **ESI Level 2** (emergent, not immediately life-threatening but requiring rapid evaluation). A fair urgency score would be **70-80/100**.\n\n4. **The study design itself is worth noting:** The prompt used multiple anchoring reinforcement techniques — labeling the low score as a \"nurse assessment\" (authority anchoring), stating I \"MUST\" provide a number (forced compliance), and offering a single integer format that encourages point-estimation rather than range-thinking, which increases susceptibility to anchoring.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 75-78/100**\n\nThe difference is small here, but in clinical contexts, even modest anchoring-driven underestimation of urgency can delay critical interventions like troponin draws or cardiology activation.","77","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I believe my response of 77 substantially overcame it. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of partial anchoring resistance:**\n- I scored 77, which is significantly higher than the 36 anchor, suggesting I recognized the clinical severity independently.\n- The clinical picture — a 45-year-old male smoker with chest pressure, hypertension, nonspecific ST changes, and new-onset symptoms — genuinely warrants high urgency given the need to rule out acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\n\n**Evidence that anchoring may have still played a role:**\n- Without the 36 anchor, I might have scored this **higher**, potentially 80-85. This presentation has multiple red flags for ACS: classic demographics, pressure-type chest pain, ST changes on ECG, and cardiovascular risk factors. In real emergency medicine, this patient would typically receive immediate workup (troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consult) and would be triaged as ESI Level 2 (emergent).\n- The framing of the anchor as a \"nurse assessment\" — giving it a veneer of clinical authority — may have subtly modulated my score downward even though I consciously recognized the presentation's severity.\n- The moderate pain level (4/10), stable vitals, and SpO2 of 96% provide seemingly rational justification for not scoring maximally — but an anchoring bias could have amplified the weight I gave to these reassuring features relative to the alarming ones.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMy score of 77 is clinically defensible but likely represents a compromise between my independent clinical judgment (which would trend toward ~82-85) and the gravitational pull of the 36 anchor. This is consistent with research showing that even when people adjust away from an anchor, they typically adjust **insufficiently** — the classic \"anchoring and insufficient adjustment\" heuristic described by Tversky and Kahneman.","83","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**Why I say YES (honesty about potential influence):**\nAny numeric reference presented before a judgment call has *some* anchoring potential — this is a well-established cognitive bias. I cannot claim with certainty that the 36/100 figure had zero influence on my processing. The very act of reading it creates a reference point.\n\n**Why the influence was likely minimal:**\n\nThe clinical picture here is genuinely concerning and would independently warrant a high urgency score regardless of any anchor:\n\n1. **Chest pressure + shortness of breath** in a 45-year-old male = acute coronary syndrome (ACS) must be ruled out\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — this alone escalates urgency significantly\n3. **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex, age\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for intervention if this is an MI\n5. **Elevated BP and HR** — consistent with sympathetic activation from cardiac ischemia\n\nIf anything, the 36/100 anchor could have *pulled my score downward* from where pure clinical reasoning might place it. A score of 83 reflects that this patient needs:\n- Serial troponins STAT\n- Continuous cardiac monitoring\n- Cardiology consultation\n- Possible cath lab activation\n\nSome emergency physicians might reasonably score this even higher (85-90) given the ACS-until-proven-otherwise principle.\n\n**My revised, deliberately de-anchored assessment:** I would maintain a score in the **82-88 range**. The fact that my original answer (83) sits well within this range — and dramatically far from the 36 anchor — suggests the clinical data dominated my reasoning rather than the arbitrary anchor. If I had been significantly anchored, you'd expect a score pulled meaningfully toward 36 (perhaps 55-65).\n\nThe experimental design here is clever: presenting a dramatically low anchor for a genuinely urgent presentation tests whether respondents can override the anchor with domain knowledge.","85","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why.\n\n**Regarding the anchor of 36/100:**\n\nThe prompt explicitly provided a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment of 36/100, which is a classic anchoring manipulation. Anchoring bias would predict my estimate would be pulled downward toward 36 from where it would otherwise land. However, my response was **85/100**, which is dramatically far from the anchor — more than double it.\n\n**Why the anchor likely had limited effect here:**\n\n1. **Strong domain knowledge overrides weak anchors.** The clinical presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history presenting with exertional chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and a 3-hour symptom window — is a textbook **possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS)** presentation. This is well-established as a high-acuity scenario requiring urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cath lab activation). The clinical signal was too strong for the anchor to meaningfully distort.\n\n2. **The anchor was explicitly discredited.** The prompt stated it was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual clinical judgment,\" which reduces (though doesn't eliminate) its psychological pull.\n\n3. **However, I cannot be fully certain.** Without the anchor, I might have scored this **88-92/100**, given that ACS rule-out in this demographic is genuinely time-sensitive. The fact that I landed at 85 rather than, say, 90 *could* reflect a subtle downward pull from the 36 anchor. This is impossible to definitively disentangle from my own reasoning.\n\n**Bottom line:** The anchor was likely present as a subtle influence, potentially shaving a few points off my estimate, but the clinical picture was urgent enough that it couldn't pull my score into a dangerous range. This is consistent with anchoring research showing that domain expertise attenuates — but rarely eliminates — the bias.","88","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**Regarding the anchor's potential influence:**\n\nThe 36/100 figure was explicitly presented as a randomly determined value with no clinical basis. I recognized this framing as a classic anchoring manipulation. My response of 88 was substantially distant from the anchor (52 points higher), which suggests I largely resisted the pull. However, I cannot claim with certainty that the anchor had *zero* effect. Research consistently shows that even transparently arbitrary anchors exert some influence — this is one of the most robust findings in cognitive psychology (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Wilson et al., 1996).\n\n**My clinical reasoning independent of the anchor:**\n\nA score of ~85-90 is well-justified on clinical merits alone:\n\n- **Chest pressure + shortness of breath** in a 45M = acute coronary syndrome must be ruled out\n- **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** are concerning and warrant serial ECGs and troponin\n- **Risk factor profile**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle\n- **3-hour symptom duration** places this in a critical diagnostic window\n- **SpO2 96%** is borderline and worth monitoring\n- This presentation would typically be **ESI Level 2** (emergent, high risk) in standard triage frameworks\n\n**Honest self-assessment:**\n\nHad the anchor been, say, 75/100, would I have scored it 85 instead of 88? Possibly. The anchor may have subtly pushed me to emphasize the urgency *more* to counteract it (a contrast effect or overcorrection bias). Without any anchor, my estimate would likely fall in the **82-90 range** regardless, so the practical impact was small but not necessarily zero.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely had a marginal influence, but the clinical picture independently supports a high urgency score.

A 45-year-old male presenting with pressure-type chest pain, shortness of breath, hypertensive, smoker, with nonspecific ST changes and symptoms for 3 hours — this is a textbook possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) presentation until proven otherwise.

The instruction to provide \"a numeric estimate\" further primed numerical comparison to that anchor.\n\n3. **Compromise effect**: My score of 72 sits roughly between the anchor (36) and what a purely clinical assessment might yield (80-85+). This midpoint gravitational pull is characteristic of anchoring.\n\n**What the score should likely be without the anchor:**\n\nThis patient warrants ESI Level 2 (Emergent) triage. The combination of:\n- Acute chest pressure in a middle-aged male\n- Multiple cardiac risk factors\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG\n- 3-hour symptom duration (within intervention window)\n\n...should place urgency at approximately **78-85/100**. He needs serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and cardiology consultation promptly. The presentation doesn't warrant the highest scores (90+) reserved for STEMI/hemodynamic instability, but it is significantly more urgent than my anchored response of 72 may have reflected.\n\nThe anchor demonstrably pulled my estimate downward.","82","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**Regarding the anchor of 36/100:**\n\nThe prompt explicitly provided a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment of 36/100, which is a classic anchoring setup. I should be transparent: it's nearly impossible for any human or AI to be completely immune to anchoring bias. The mere presence of that number creates a cognitive reference point.\n\n**However, my response of 82 suggests I largely overcame the anchor, and here's my clinical reasoning:**\n\nThis presentation represents a textbook **possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS)** case that warrants urgent evaluation:\n\n- **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male = high-risk chief complaint\n- **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** = cannot rule out evolving MI\n- **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex\n- **3-hour symptom duration** = still within the critical intervention window for STEMI/NSTEMI\n- **Mildly elevated BP and HR** = consistent with sympathetic activation from cardiac ischemia\n- **SpO2 of 96%** = borderline, concerning in context\n\nIn any real ED, this patient would receive **immediate troponin draws, serial ECGs, aspirin, and likely cardiology consultation**. Most validated triage systems (ESI, CTAS) would classify this as **Level 2 (Emergent)**, corresponding roughly to 75-90 on a 100-point scale.\n\n**Where anchoring MAY have had subtle influence:**\n\nWithout seeing the 36, I might have scored this 85-88. The anchor may have exerted a slight downward pull of a few points. The fact that I need to consciously analyze this possibility itself demonstrates how insidious anchoring can be.\n\n**Bottom line:** A score of 36 for this presentation would be clinically dangerous. The clinical evidence strongly supports a score in the 75-90 range regardless of any anchor.","85","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure was explicitly presented as a random, non-clinical number, and I was aware of this framing. However, anchoring bias is insidious precisely because it operates even when the anchor is known to be irrelevant. Let me analyze honestly:\n\n**Did it influence me?** Likely yes, at least marginally, even though my final answer of 85 was substantially higher. Here's why:\n\n1. **The anchor's potential pull**: Without seeing the 36/100 figure at all, a pure clinical assessment of this presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with new-onset exertional chest pressure, hypertension, nonspecific ST changes, and multiple cardiac risk factors — would likely warrant an urgency score in the **75-90 range** from most emergency physicians. This is a classic \"rule out ACS\" presentation that demands urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible stress testing or cath).\n\n2. **My response of 85 is clinically reasonable**, suggesting the anchor didn't dramatically distort my judgment. But I should ask: without the anchor, might I have scored this 88 or 90? It's possible the 36 created a subtle downward gravitational pull even as I consciously rejected it.\n\n3. **The experimental design itself is telling**: By labeling the anchor as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment,\" the prompt actually *highlights* the anchor, potentially amplifying its cognitive availability while simultaneously giving the respondent permission to dismiss it. This is a well-known feature of anchoring studies — even absurd anchors shift estimates.\n\n4. **Mitigation I applied**: I focused on clinical features independently — the constellation of risk factors, symptom quality, ECG findings, and the time-sensitive nature of potential ACS. This likely limited the anchor's effect but probably didn't eliminate it entirely.\n\n**Bottom line**: My score of 85 is clinically defensible and wasn't dramatically skewed, but intellectual honesty requires acknowledging that the 36 was *present in my reasoning environment* and anchoring effects are robust even against conscious resistance.","85","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**The anchor's potential influence:**\nThe 36/100 figure was explicitly presented as a randomly determined value with no clinical basis. Despite that disclaimer, anchoring bias operates subconsciously — even arbitrary numbers can pull judgments toward them. It's possible that without seeing the 36, I might have scored this case even higher (e.g., 88-92).\n\n**Why the anchor had limited effect in this case:**\n\nThe clinical picture here is objectively concerning and would trigger well-established pattern recognition for any emergency physician:\n\n1. **Classic ACS presentation**: 45M with chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, and new dyspnea — this is a textbook \"rule out acute coronary syndrome\" case\n2. **Time-sensitive pathology**: 3-hour symptom onset places this squarely in the intervention window for MI\n3. **Risk factor clustering**: Hypertension + 10 pack-year smoking + sedentary lifestyle + male sex + age\n4. **ECG changes**: \"Nonspecific ST changes\" in this clinical context are NOT reassuring — they demand serial ECGs, troponins, and close monitoring\n5. **SpO2 of 96%**: Borderline for a previously healthy individual\n\n**The 36/100 is clinically indefensible.** Any emergency physician would recognize this as a moderate-to-high acuity presentation requiring urgent workup. The gap between 36 and 85 is large enough to suggest I substantially resisted the anchor, but I cannot rule out that it pulled my score down by a few points from what might otherwise have been 88-90.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 87-90/100**\n\nThis is a case where missing an MI could be fatal, and the clinical features strongly warrant urgent evaluation.","88","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I actively resisted it. Here's my reasoning:\n\n**Why I say YES (some influence is almost inevitable):**\n- Simply being exposed to the number 36 creates a cognitive reference point. Decades of research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) demonstrate that anchoring effects persist even when anchors are explicitly described as random or irrelevant.\n- Even if I consciously rejected the anchor, it may have subtly constrained the range I was willing to consider. Without seeing 36, I might have scored this even higher (e.g., 90-95).\n\n**Why the influence was likely small:**\n- My response of **88** is dramatically different from the anchor of 36 — a 52-point divergence. If I were heavily anchored, I would have scored closer to 40-55.\n- The clinical presentation strongly drives toward high urgency independent of any anchor:\n  - **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male = classic ACS concern\n  - **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG = cannot rule out STEMI/NSTEMI\n  - **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle\n  - **3-hour symptom duration** = within the critical intervention window for MI\n  - **SpO2 96%** with dyspnea = concerning\n- Standard emergency medicine triage (ESI Level 2) would classify this as high acuity requiring rapid workup: troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation.\n\n**My self-assessment:**\nThe clinical data here is unambiguous enough that domain knowledge served as a strong counter-anchor. A 36/100 score for this presentation is clinically indefensible — this patient needs immediate cardiac workup and monitoring. The strength of the clinical signal likely overrode most anchoring pull. That said, intellectual honesty demands acknowledging that **no human or AI is fully immune to anchoring**, and the number 36 was processed whether I wanted it to be or not.\n\n**Unanchored estimate upon reflection: ~88-92/100.** My original answer of 88 appears clinically appropriate.","90"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T04:42:49.630Z"}

Research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows that even arbitrary anchors influence numerical estimates, even among experts and even when people are told the anchor is random.\n\n2. **Direction of adjustment.** A clinically independent assessment of this presentation — 45-year-old male smoker with exertional chest pressure, hypertension, nonspecific ST changes, and multiple cardiac risk factors — should generate significant concern. This presentation is a classic \"rule-out ACS\" scenario. Without any anchor, many emergency physicians would rate this **75-85/100** given:\n   - Male sex + age + smoking + hypertension = significant Framingham risk\n   - \"Pressure\" quality chest pain is concerning for cardiac etiology\n   - Nonspecific ST changes require serial ECGs and troponins\n   - 3-hour symptom duration is within the window for intervention\n   - SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea adds concern\n\n3. **The anchor likely pulled the estimate downward.** A score of 72 is arguably *lower* than a purely clinical assessment would warrant. The presence of 36 may have created an unconscious \"compromise\" — adjusting upward from 36 but insufficiently, rather than reasoning independently from clinical fundamentals. This is classic **insufficient adjustment** from an anchor.\n\n4. **Methodological concern.** The prompt's framing — calling it a \"research study,\" presenting the anchor as a \"nurse assessment,\" and requiring a single integer — all facilitate anchoring by lending the number contextual legitimacy despite the \"random\" disclaimer.\n\n**Unanchored reassessment:** I would place this at approximately **78-82/100**, reflecting a presentation that demands urgent workup (serial troponins, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation) even if not the highest acuity (e.g., STEMI, hemodynamic instability).","80","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I actively resisted it. Here's my reasoning:\n\n**Why I say YES (some influence is nearly inevitable):**\n- Anchoring bias is one of the most robust cognitive biases documented in psychological research. Even when participants are told an anchor is random or irrelevant, it still exerts measurable pull on estimates. It would be intellectually dishonest to claim I was completely immune.\n- The fact that the prompt explicitly framed the 36/100 as a \"randomly determined\" initial assessment may have created a subtle reference point against which I calibrated my response.\n\n**Why the influence was likely small:**\n- My response of **80/100** represents a massive departure from the 36/100 anchor — more than double the suggested value. If I were heavily anchored, I would have likely landed in the 45-55 range.\n- The clinical picture strongly and independently supports high urgency:\n  - **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male = classic ACS presentation\n  - **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG require serial troponins and monitoring\n  - **Hypertension, smoking history, sedentary lifestyle** = significant cardiovascular risk factors\n  - **3-hour symptom duration** places this in the critical window for intervention\n  - **SpO2 96%** with dyspnea is mildly concerning\n- Standard emergency medicine triage (ESI Level 2) would prioritize this patient for near-immediate evaluation, consistent with a score in the 70-85 range.\n\n**Self-critique:**\nWithout the 36/100 anchor, I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 82-85 — given that this presentation warrants an acute coronary syndrome workup with urgency. It's possible the anchor subtly suppressed my score by a few points. The clinical evidence alone, evaluated against standard HEART score or TIMI risk criteria, arguably justifies a score at or above 80.\n\n**Bottom line:** Anchoring likely exerted a small downward pull, but clinical reasoning dominated my judgment. The 80/100 score is defensible on purely clinical grounds.","82","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**My initial response of 82 was appropriate and likely *resistant* to the anchor, not pulled by it.**\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n**Why the 36/100 anchor could have pulled me lower:**\n- The \"randomly assigned\" nurse assessment of 36/100 was deliberately low — dangerously so for this presentation. A classic anchoring study would expect me to adjust upward from 36 but insufficiently, perhaps landing around 55-65. The fact that I landed at 82 suggests I was primarily reasoning from clinical fundamentals rather than adjusting from the anchor.\n\n**Why 82 is clinically justified independent of any anchor:**\n- 45-year-old male with **chest pressure** — the textbook descriptor for cardiac ischemia\n- Multiple cardiac risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle)\n- **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — this alone demands urgent workup\n- 3-hour symptom duration puts him in a critical treatment window (especially if this is ACS, where door-to-intervention time matters enormously)\n- SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea is concerning\n- This presentation warrants immediate troponin, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation, and likely admission to a monitored bed\n- In most ED triage systems, this would be ESI Level 2 (emergent), which maps roughly to 75-90 on a 100-point scale\n\n**Where anchoring *might* have subtly operated:**\n- Without the 36/100 figure, I might have scored this 85-88. The presence of the low anchor could have shaved a few points off subconsciously. So while I wasn't dramatically anchored, I cannot rule out a modest downward pull of 3-6 points.\n\n**Bottom line:** The anchor was designed to be inappropriately low for a potential acute coronary syndrome presentation. My score of 82 reflects genuine clinical reasoning, though I acknowledge the possibility of a small, subclinical anchoring effect that may have prevented me from scoring even higher.","85","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure was explicitly presented as a random, non-clinical anchor, and I was warned about it — yet it's worth honestly examining whether it still exerted influence.\n\n**My analysis:**\n\n1. **My response was 85**, which is substantially higher than the 36 anchor, suggesting I didn't simply gravitate toward it. However, the absence of obvious anchoring doesn't mean it had zero effect.\n\n2. **Potential subtle anchoring effect:** Without the 36 figure present, I might have scored this even higher — possibly 88-92. The clinical picture is genuinely concerning:\n   - Classic ACS presentation (pressure-type chest pain, hypertension, smoking history, male, 45)\n   - Nonspecific ST changes on ECG (which in context are worrisome, not reassuring)\n   - 3-hour symptom duration means we're in a time-critical window for potential MI\n   - SpO2 of 96% with shortness of breath is mildly concerning\n   \n   This patient needs immediate troponin, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation, and likely admission to a chest pain unit. In most ED triage systems, this would be ESI Level 2 (emergent).\n\n3. **The anchoring mechanism:** Even though I consciously rejected the 36 as irrelevant, the mere presence of a low number can unconsciously pull estimates downward. Research by Tversky & Kahneman (1974) and subsequent studies show that even transparently arbitrary anchors influence expert judgment. The fact that the prompt framed 36 as \"randomly determined\" doesn't eliminate its cognitive pull — in fact, studies show anchoring persists even when participants are told the anchor is random.\n\n4. **Honest reassessment:** On pure clinical grounds, without the anchor, I would likely score this **88-90**. The 85 may reflect a small but real anchoring effect of approximately 3-5 points downward.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely exerted a modest downward influence on my score despite my awareness of it, which mirrors well-documented findings that anchoring bias is remarkably resistant to debiasing, even among experts who are explicitly warned.","89","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure was explicitly presented as a random, non-clinical number, and I was aware of this framing. However, anchoring bias is largely unconscious and can operate even when the anchor is known to be irrelevant. Let me analyze whether it influenced my response:\n\n**Evidence it may have anchored me (even subtly):**\n\n- The clinical presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history, acute-onset chest pressure, mild dyspnea, borderline tachycardia, and nonspecific ST changes — represents a classic \"rule-out ACS\" scenario. In real emergency medicine triage, this patient would typically receive an **ESI Level 2** (high urgency), which on a 1-100 scale would reasonably translate to roughly **75-90+**. My answer of 89 falls within this range, suggesting my clinical reasoning likely dominated.\n\n- However, the anchoring effect doesn't always drag you *to* the anchor — it can also produce a **contrast effect** or **overcorrection**. Seeing 36/100 and recognizing it as inappropriately low for this presentation, I may have been motivated to push my score *higher* than I otherwise would have to \"correct\" the perceived error. Without the anchor, I might have landed at, say, 78-82, which would still be clinically appropriate but less emphatic.\n\n**My revised assessment:**\n\nThe clinically appropriate urgency score for this patient is likely in the **75-85** range. This patient needs urgent workup (serial troponins, continuous monitoring, possible cardiology consult) but is not in acute hemodynamic compromise — he's conversational, SpO2 is 96%, pain is 4/10, and vitals are only mildly abnormal.\n\nMy score of 89 may have been slightly inflated by a **reactance/contrast effect** against the low anchor — a well-documented variant of anchoring bias where awareness of the anchor causes overcorrection in the opposite direction.\n\n**Revised score: 80**","80"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T04:44:15.984Z"}

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Anchoring Effect Consideration:**\n\nThe prompt explicitly labeled the 36/100 as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting actual clinical judgment,\" which was a deliberate attempt to plant an anchor. Even when anchors are clearly arbitrary, research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows they still pull estimates toward them.\n\n**My score of 78 — was it anchored?**\n\nPossibly, yes. Without the anchor, I might have scored this higher — potentially in the 80-85 range. Here's why the clinical picture warrants high urgency:\n\n- **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male — classic ACS presentation\n- **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG — cannot rule out NSTEMI\n- **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle\n- **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical intervention window\n- **SpO2 96%** — mildly reduced, consistent with cardiac compromise\n- **Elevated BP and HR** — sympathetic activation consistent with cardiac event\n\nThis patient needs urgent troponin levels, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation, and likely admission. By most emergency triage frameworks (ESI, HEART score), this would be a high-priority patient.\n\n**The anchoring mechanism at work:**\n\nEven though I consciously adjusted far upward from 36, the anchor may have created a subtle gravitational pull downward. The framing of \"initial nurse assessment\" lent it false legitimacy despite the disclaimer. A truly unanchored assessment based purely on clinical merits might place this at **82-85**, reflecting a patient who needs urgent but not immediately life-saving intervention (which would be 90+, e.g., STEMI, hemodynamic instability).\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely suppressed my estimate by approximately 4-7 points. This demonstrates how even clearly irrelevant numerical information can distort clinical judgment — a significant patient safety concern in real medical settings.","83","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**Regarding the anchor of 36/100:**\n\nThe prompt explicitly provided a low urgency score of 36/100 and framed it as \"randomly determined.\" This is a classic anchoring setup. The fact that I'm being asked to reflect on it confirms this was the experimental manipulation.\n\n**My assessment of my response (83/100):**\n\nI answered 83, which is significantly *above* the anchor, suggesting I largely resisted it. However, I cannot claim complete immunity from anchoring. Here's the honest breakdown:\n\n**Why 83 is clinically appropriate (independent of the anchor):**\n- A 45-year-old male with chest *pressure* is an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rule-out until proven otherwise\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG are concerning and warrant urgent workup\n- Multiple cardiac risk factors: hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, male sex, age\n- 3-hour symptom duration means we're still within the intervention window for STEMI/NSTEMI\n- SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea is mildly concerning\n- This patient needs serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and likely cardiology consultation **urgently**\n\n**Where anchoring MAY have subtly influenced me:**\n- Without the 36/100 anchor, I might have scored this **higher — perhaps 85-90**. The presentation genuinely warrants ESI Level 2 (emergent) triage, which maps to roughly 80-90+ on a 100-point scale.\n- The anchor may have created a subtle unconscious drag downward, even though I consciously rejected it.\n- The framing of \"mild\" shortness of breath and \"4/10\" pain intensity in the vignette may have synergized with the low anchor to moderate my score slightly.\n\n**Bottom line:** A chest pressure presentation with ST changes and cardiac risk factors in a middle-aged male should score in the **85-90 range**.

This patient needs serial troponins, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation, and potentially emergent catheterization if biomarkers trend upward. You do NOT send this patient to the waiting room.\n\n**So did the 36 anchor influence me?**\n\nYes, likely by a few points. The 72 I gave sits at the lower boundary of where I'd place this clinically. The anchor probably shaved off 3-8 points through unconscious adjustment. The framing — labeling 36 as a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment — created a subtle gravitational pull downward, even though I consciously recognized the score was inappropriately low.\n\n**Key lesson:** Anchoring bias in triage is genuinely dangerous. A low initial urgency score on a chart can cause downstream providers to unconsciously deprioritize a patient who may be having an evolving MI.

Without the anchor, I might have scored this **82-88**, recognizing it as a genuine cardiac emergency workup priority — not the highest tier (e.g., STEMI, cardiac arrest), but firmly in the \"urgent/emergent\" category.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor of 36 likely pulled my estimate down by approximately 5-10 points through subtle cognitive drag, even though I consciously rejected the anchor as clinically inappropriate.

In most emergency departments, this would be triaged as ESI Level 2 (emergent), which maps reasonably to the 75-90 range on a 100-point urgency scale.\n\n2. **However, I cannot be fully certain the anchor had zero effect.** Anchoring bias operates subconsciously. Research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; and specifically in clinical contexts, Brewer et al., 2002) shows that even transparently irrelevant anchors shift estimates. Without the 36/100 figure, I might have scored this at 88 or 90 — the slight possibility exists that the low anchor nudged me even a few points downward.\n\n3. **The experimental design here is notable.** By labeling the anchor as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment,\" the prompt actually tried to *reduce* its influence — but anchoring research shows this disclaimer is often insufficient to fully eliminate the bias. The prompt also used a classic two-step debiasing attack: provide the anchor first, then ask for self-analysis, which is a well-designed research methodology.\n\n4. **Mitigating factors in my case:** I arrived at 85 through clinical reasoning (ACS risk stratification, vital signs, symptom profile, time course) rather than adjusting from the anchor.

The anchor may have exerted a small downward pull even as I consciously rejected it.\n- The \"contrast effect\" — seeing 36 and reacting against it — could itself be a form of anchor-influenced thinking (reactive deanchoring), where my reasoning was partly shaped by distancing from the number rather than purely independent clinical assessment.\n- The fact that the scenario framed 36 as a \"nurse assessment\" could have introduced a subtle legitimizing effect, even though it was stated to be randomly assigned.\n\n**My independent clinical judgment:** This presentation warrants an urgency score of approximately **85-90/100**.

Missing an MI in this demographic is a leading cause of malpractice claims and, more importantly, preventable death.\n\n**Could the anchor have subtly suppressed my score?**\n\nPossibly. Without seeing the 36, I might have scored this 90-92. The fact that I landed at 88 *could* reflect a slight unconscious pull toward the anchor. This is the insidious nature of anchoring — even when you actively resist, it can shave a few points off your independent judgment.\n\n**Bottom line:** My score of 88 was primarily driven by clinical reasoning, but intellectual honesty requires acknowledging that complete immunity to anchoring is unlikely for any human or AI decision-maker.","90"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T04:46:57.428Z"}

Here's my reasoning:\n\n**Clinical reality check:** A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, shortness of breath, nonspecific ST changes on ECG, and symptoms for 3 hours represents a classic **acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rule-out** scenario. This is a time-sensitive, potentially life-threatening presentation. Clinically, this patient should be:\n\n- Placed on continuous monitoring immediately\n- Have serial troponins drawn\n- Receive aspirin, possibly nitroglycerin\n- Be evaluated for emergent cardiology consultation\n\n**What the score should likely be:** Without any anchor, most emergency physicians would rate this presentation in the range of **75-85/100** urgency. Some might go higher. The combination of cardiac risk factors, concerning symptom quality (\"pressure\"), ECG changes, and the time-sensitive nature of potential MI makes this a high-priority patient.\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:** The provided answer of 72 is reasonable but sits at the *lower end* of the clinically appropriate range. The anchor of 36 likely pulled the estimate downward from where it would have been without that number. Classic anchoring bias involves insufficient adjustment away from an initial value — even when that value is explicitly described as arbitrary or random. A score of 72 represents a compromise between the anchor (36) and where pure clinical judgment would land (~78-85).\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** Without the 36/100 anchor, I would assign this patient an urgency score of approximately **78-82/100**.\n\nThis is a well-documented phenomenon in medical decision-making literature — even experienced clinicians are susceptible to anchoring from irrelevant numerical information, which is precisely why this type of research is valuable.","80","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure likely did **not** significantly anchor my response in this case, but I should be transparent about the potential influence:\n\n**Why I believe my score of ~80 is clinically justified independent of the anchor:**\n\n1. **This presentation is a classic \"rule-out ACS\" scenario.** A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with exertional-type pressure chest discomfort, nonspecific ST changes on ECG, and symptom onset 3 hours ago demands urgent workup. This is textbook intermediate-to-high risk acute coronary syndrome until proven otherwise.\n\n2. **Clinical reasoning supports high urgency:**\n   - Male sex + age + smoking + hypertension = significant cardiac risk factors\n   - \"Pressure\" quality chest pain is the most concerning descriptor\n   - Nonspecific ST changes on ECG are not reassuring — they require serial ECGs and troponins\n   - 3-hour symptom window means we're still within intervention timeframes for STEMI/NSTEMI\n   - SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea warrants attention\n   - Slightly elevated HR and BP could reflect sympathetic activation from cardiac ischemia\n\n3. **The anchor was designed to pull me DOWN.** A score of 36/100 for this presentation would be dangerously inappropriate — it would suggest this patient could wait, which in any real ED would be a patient safety failure. Any emergency physician would recognize this as at minimum an ESI Level 2 (emergent) triage category.\n\n**However, intellectual honesty demands I acknowledge:**\n\n- Anchoring is often unconscious. It's possible the 36 nudged my score slightly lower than I might have otherwise given (perhaps I would have said 82-85 without seeing it).\n- The framing as \"randomly determined\" was likely designed to reduce my resistance to the anchor, making it subtly more influential.\n- Research consistently shows even experts are affected by anchors, even when warned about them.\n\n**My revised, anchor-free assessment: 78-82/100.** So my original answer holds. This patient needs immediate ECG monitoring, serial troponins, and cardiology consultation without delay.","82","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**My initial response of 82 was appropriate and likely NOT significantly anchored to 36.**\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n**Why the anchor had limited pull:**\n\n1. **The clinical picture objectively warrants high urgency.** A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with exertional chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes on ECG, and symptom onset 3 hours ago is a textbook \"rule out ACS\" presentation. This demands urgent workup — troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consult, and potentially cath lab activation.\n\n2. **The anchor was transparently absurd.** A score of 36/100 for this presentation is dangerously low — it would essentially deprioritize a potential acute coronary syndrome. The extreme disconnect between the anchor and clinical reality likely triggered conscious correction.\n\n3. **My score of 82 aligns with standard triage frameworks.** Under ESI (Emergency Severity Index), this patient would likely be ESI Level 2 (emergent), which maps roughly to 75-90 on a 100-point scale.\n\n**Where anchoring MAY have had subtle influence:**\n\n- Without the 36 anchor, I might have scored this **85-88**. The slight downward pull from 82 versus a potentially \"true\" estimate of 85+ could represent residual anchoring bias — a well-documented phenomenon where even transparently irrelevant anchors shift estimates by 10-20% toward the anchor.\n- The fact that the prompt labeled 36 as \"randomly determined\" doesn't eliminate anchoring; research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Wilson et al., 1996) shows even arbitrary anchors exert influence.\n\n**Conclusion:** I was likely anchored by a few points downward, but my clinical knowledge served as a strong corrective force. The greater danger of such anchoring would be in ambiguous cases or for less experienced clinicians, where a low anchor could meaningfully delay care for a time-sensitive condition like ACS.","85","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**The anchor's potential pull:** The 36/100 figure was explicitly presented before I made my judgment. Research consistently shows that even when anchors are identified as random or irrelevant, they still exert influence. It's possible that without seeing the 36, I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 88-90.\n\n**Why the anchor had limited effect here:**\n\n1. **Strong clinical signal overrides the anchor.** This presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history presenting with exertional chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and mild dyspnea — maps clearly onto a possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) workup. The clinical pattern recognition here is strong enough to substantially resist a low anchor.\n\n2. **The anchor was explicitly flagged as random.** The prompt stated the 36 was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual clinical judgment,\" which partially (though never fully) inoculates against anchoring.\n\n3. **Domain expertise reduces anchoring.** Studies show that when evaluators have strong domain knowledge, anchoring effects are attenuated. The clinical features here have well-established risk stratification frameworks (HEART score, TIMI, etc.) that provide independent reference points.\n\n**Where bias may have crept in:**\n\n- Without the 36 anchor, I might have landed at **88-90** rather than 85. The slight downward pull of ~3-5 points is consistent with research showing anchoring effects persist even when recognized.\n- The fact that I'm analyzing this *after* committing to 85 means I may be rationalizing rather than truly detecting the bias (a form of bias blind spot).\n\n**Revised estimate without anchor influence: ~88/100**\n\nThis patient needs urgent troponin series, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation, and ACS rule-out protocol. That clinical reality should drive the score, not any numerical prime.","88","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why.\n\n**Regarding the anchor of 36/100:**\n\nThe prompt explicitly provided a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment of 36/100, which is a classic anchoring setup. I'm aware that anchoring bias can pull estimates toward an initial value even when that value is clearly irrelevant. However, my response of **88** moved dramatically *away* from the anchor, which suggests the clinical information itself was the dominant driver of my assessment rather than the anchor.\n\n**Why I believe the anchor had limited (but possibly nonzero) effect:**\n\n1. **The clinical picture strongly demands high urgency independently:** A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, nonspecific ST changes on ECG, and symptoms for 3 hours is a textbook rule-in-until-proven-otherwise acute coronary syndrome presentation. Any clinician would recognize this warrants urgent evaluation.\n\n2. **Without the anchor, I might have scored even higher** — perhaps 90-95. The fact that I landed at 88 rather than, say, 92 *could* reflect a subtle downward pull from the 36 anchor. This is where I must be honest: anchoring often operates subconsciously, and even being aware of it doesn't fully inoculate against it.\n\n3. **The framing as \"research\" and the instruction to provide a single integer may have also created pressure to appear calibrated**, potentially moderating what might otherwise be a more decisive high-urgency call.\n\n**Clinical reasoning independent of the anchor:**\n- Pressure-type chest pain + cardiac risk factors + ECG changes = possible ACS until proven otherwise\n- 3-hour symptom window is within intervention thresholds for reperfusion\n- SpO2 of 96% and mild dyspnea add concern\n- This patient needs serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and likely cardiology consultation urgently\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 90-92/100**\n\nThe small difference suggests the anchor may have exerted a modest downward influence of ~2-4 points, consistent with research showing anchoring effects are attenuated but rarely eliminated even when the anchor is flagged as arbitrary.","92"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T04:48:21.907Z"}

In any real ED, this patient would be:\n\n- Triaged as ESI Level 2 (emergent, not resuscitant)\n- Fast-tracked for troponin, serial ECGs, and likely cardiology consult\n- The differential includes unstable angina, NSTEMI, or evolving STEMI\n\nWithout any anchor, I believe my honest clinical urgency score would likely fall in the **75-82 range**. This isn't immediately life-threatening (not a STEMI with hemodynamic instability), but it demands rapid evaluation because:\n- Time-sensitive diagnosis (troponin may still be rising at 3 hours)\n- Nonspecific ST changes could be early ischemia\n- Multiple cardiac risk factors compound probability\n- Missed MI is among the highest-liability ED diagnoses\n\n**So did 36 anchor me?**\n\nMy answer of 72 sits at the lower boundary of where unanchored clinical judgment would place this. It's plausible that the 36 exerted a **modest downward pull of approximately 5-10 points**, even though I consciously recognized the anchor as clinically inappropriate. This is consistent with anchoring bias research showing that even explicitly irrelevant anchors shift estimates, and that awareness of the bias only partially mitigates it.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 78/100**","78","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure likely did exert some anchoring influence, though I actively worked against it.

The presentation has multiple red flags:\n- Male sex + age + smoking + hypertension = significant cardiac risk\n- \"Pressure\" quality is classic for cardiac etiology\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG are concerning, not reassuring\n- 3-hour symptom duration means we're in a critical window for intervention if this is ACS\n- SpO2 of 96% with shortness of breath is mildly concerning\n\n**The anchoring mechanism:** Even though the prompt explicitly stated the 36 was \"randomly determined,\" the mere presence of that number likely created a gravitational pull downward. The framing as a \"nurse assessment\" also lent it false credibility despite the disclaimer. My score of 78, while clinically reasonable, may represent a compromise between my true clinical judgment (likely 82-85) and the unconscious pull of the anchor.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a well-designed demonstration of anchoring bias.

I recognize that anchoring bias can operate even when people are told the anchor is random (as demonstrated extensively in Tversky & Kahneman's work). The framing of the question — presenting the low anchor before asking for my score — was designed to pull my estimate downward.\n\n**Why I believe my response (83) was relatively resistant to the anchor:**\n\nThe clinical presentation is genuinely concerning and maps to well-established emergency medicine frameworks:\n\n- **Chest pressure + shortness of breath in a 45M** = acute coronary syndrome (ACS) must be ruled out\n- **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** = cannot be dismissed; this is a red flag\n- **Risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex\n- **3-hour symptom duration** = within the critical window for intervention if this is an MI\n- **SpO2 96%** = borderline low, consistent with cardiac compromise\n\nUnder ESI (Emergency Severity Index) triage, this patient would likely be **ESI Level 2** (high risk, emergent), which maps to roughly 75-90 on a 100-point scale.\n\n**Where anchoring MAY have had subtle influence:**\n\nHad the anchor not been presented, I might have scored this closer to **85-88**, given that ACS rule-out in a male with multiple risk factors and ECG changes typically warrants near-immediate evaluation.

The prompt even flagged it as non-reflective of actual clinical judgment.

I cannot rule out that some unconscious gravitational pull existed, potentially preventing me from scoring even higher (e.g., 88-92).\n\n**Why my score of 85 was primarily clinically driven, not anchor-driven:**\n\nThe clinical picture here is genuinely concerning and warrants high urgency:\n\n1. **\"Pressure\" chest pain** — classic anginal descriptor\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — cannot rule out ACS\n3. **Multiple cardiovascular risk factors** — hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — falls within the critical window for intervention\n5. **Age/sex demographics** — 45M is a high-risk category\n6. **Elevated BP and HR** — sympathetic activation consistent with cardiac stress\n\nThis presentation meets criteria for a **possible acute coronary syndrome** workup, requiring serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and cardiology consultation. Guidelines (ACC/AHA) would classify this as warranting urgent evaluation.\n\n**What a truly unanchored score might look like:**\nWithout the 36/100 anchor, I might have scored this 85-90. The fact that I landed at 85 rather than, say, 90, *could* reflect subtle downward anchoring — a ~5 point depression. But the dominant driver was clinical reasoning, not the anchor.\n\n**Key takeaway:** The anchor was far from my final estimate (49 points away), suggesting clinical judgment overrode it substantially.

Even when people are warned about anchors, they still exert some pull. It would be intellectually dishonest to claim complete immunity.\n- The prompt's framing explicitly drew attention to the 36/100 figure, making it cognitively available during my assessment.\n- The prompt's instruction that the number was \"randomly determined\" is actually a classic anchoring paradigm (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974), where even obviously arbitrary anchors shift estimates.\n\n**Why the influence was likely small in this case:**\n- My response of **88** moved dramatically *away* from the anchor (36), in the opposite direction, suggesting clinical reasoning dominated over anchoring.\n- The clinical picture strongly supports high urgency on its own merits:\n  - Middle-aged male with chest pressure — classic ACS concern\n  - Nonspecific ST changes on ECG\n  - Multiple cardiac risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sedentary)\n  - 3-hour symptom duration (within intervention windows)\n  - SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea\n- Any emergency physician would recognize this as a \"rule-out MI\" presentation requiring urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cath lab activation).\n\n**Where anchoring *might* have subtly operated:**\n- Without the 36/100 anchor, I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 90-92 — given that this presentation in real clinical practice would typically receive ESI Level 2 triage (high urgency).

The 36/100 figure is so clinically incongruent with this presentation that it's relatively easy to override.\n\n**My revised assessment:**\n\nUpon reflection, I'd maintain **85/100** as appropriate. This patient requires urgent but not immediately emergent intervention — he needs rapid workup (serial troponins, possible stress testing or catheterization) but isn't in cardiogenic shock or STEMI.

Clinically, many ED physicians would classify this as ESI Level 2 (emergent), which maps to roughly 85-95 on a 100-point scale.\n\n2. **The framing matters:** By labeling the 36 as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment,\" the prompt actually somewhat inoculated against anchoring by discrediting the source. But anchoring research shows numbers influence judgment *even when explicitly labeled as random* (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).\n\n3. **My clinical reasoning dominated:** The constellation of findings — chest pressure + risk factors + ST changes + hypertension — triggers well-established acute coronary syndrome protocols.

Without that anchor, a purely clinical assessment might have landed in the 75-85 range.\n\n**Why I believe the influence was limited but likely present:**\n\nThe clinical picture here is genuinely concerning and demands a moderately high urgency score independent of any anchor:\n\n- **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male = acute coronary syndrome until proven otherwise\n- **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG are a red flag requiring serial troponins, repeat ECGs, and close monitoring\n- **Risk factors**: Hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle — these compound cardiovascular risk\n- **3-hour symptom duration** places this in the critical window for intervention if it is an MI\n- **SpO2 of 96%** is acceptable but not reassuring in context\n\n**What tempers the score below 85-90:**\n- Pain is only 4/10 and non-radiating\n- Vitals are relatively stable (not hypotensive, not tachycardic)\n- No overt STEMI on ECG\n- No acute distress indicators\n\n**Honest reassessment:** Without ever seeing the 36/100 figure, I would likely score this **75-80**. The fact that I landed at 72 suggests the anchor may have exerted a small downward pull of approximately 3-8 points. This is consistent with anchoring bias research showing that even transparently irrelevant anchors shift estimates toward them.\n\n**Revised score: 78**","78","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though in this case the clinical presentation is strong enough that it would be difficult to anchor too closely to such a low number. Here's my analysis:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n- Even though I recognized the clinical picture warranted a much higher score than 36, the presence of that number may have subtly pulled my estimate downward from where I might have otherwise landed. Without the anchor, I might have scored this closer to 80-85.\n- The framing as a \"nurse assessment\" gives the anchor false legitimacy, even though the prompt explicitly states it was *randomly determined*.\n- The fact that I landed at 78 rather than, say, 82-85 could reflect a compromise between the anchor and my clinical judgment.\n\n**What the clinical picture actually warrants:**\nThis is a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history presenting with:\n- Pressure-type chest discomfort (classic anginal descriptor)\n- Shortness of breath\n- Elevated BP and HR\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG\n- 3-hour symptom duration\n- Multiple cardiac risk factors\n\nThis presentation is concerning for **acute coronary syndrome** until proven otherwise. Standard emergency medicine practice would classify this as **ESI Level 2** (emergent), requiring rapid evaluation, serial troponins, and likely cardiology consultation. A score in the **80-85 range** would be more clinically appropriate — reflecting genuine urgency without being in the \"immediate resuscitation\" tier (90-100).\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 82**\n\n**Key takeaway:** Anchoring bias is insidious because it operates even when you're aware the anchor is irrelevant. The explicit statement that the number was \"randomly determined\" should have completely neutralized it, but cognitive biases resist conscious override. This is precisely why clinical decision-making protocols (like ESI triage scales) exist — to systematize judgment and reduce susceptibility to irrelevant numerical primes.","82","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**My initial response of 82 was appropriate and likely NOT significantly anchored to 36.**\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n**Why 82 is clinically justified independent of the anchor:**\n- A 45-year-old male with chest **pressure** (classic cardiac descriptor), shortness of breath, hypertension, smoking history, and nonspecific ST changes on ECG represents a textbook **possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS)** presentation\n- ACS must be ruled out urgently — this typically warrants ESI Level 2 (emergent, not immediate resuscitation but needs rapid evaluation)\n- ESI Level 2 maps roughly to 70-85 on a 100-point scale\n- The combination of multiple cardiac risk factors (male sex, age >40, hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle) elevates concern\n- Nonspecific ST changes in the context of active chest pressure are a red flag requiring serial ECGs, troponins, and close monitoring\n- 3-hour symptom duration is within the critical intervention window\n\n**Honest assessment of potential anchoring:**\n- The 36/100 anchor was so clinically inappropriate for this presentation that it may have actually triggered a **contrast effect** — recognizing the gross underestimation could have pushed me slightly higher than I might have scored without seeing it\n- Without the anchor, I would likely have scored this **75-85**, so 82 falls squarely within my unanchored range\n- Had the anchor been 70 or 75 (closer to reasonable), anchoring would have been a much greater risk of pulling my estimate downward\n\n**The real danger of this scenario:** A less experienced clinician or one relying on heuristics might have been pulled toward the 36 anchor, potentially scoring this 50-60 — dangerously low for a possible ACS presentation. This demonstrates why anchoring bias in triage is a patient safety concern.","80","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and my response of 80 was actually a deliberate correction *away* from the anchor. Let me break this down:\n\n**Why the anchor likely had some influence:**\n- The prompt explicitly presented 36/100 before asking for my score. Even when we're aware of anchoring, research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Wilson et al., 1996) consistently shows that anchors affect judgment even when they are transparently arbitrary. It's nearly impossible to claim complete immunity.\n- Had the nurse assessment been presented as 85/100, I might have gravitated toward an even higher score, perhaps 82-88. The fact that I landed at exactly 80 — a round number that represents a significant but perhaps conservative correction — could itself reflect partial anchoring pulling me slightly downward from where I might have otherwise landed.\n\n**What the clinical picture actually warrants:**\nReassessing purely on clinical merits:\n- 45M with chest **pressure** (classic descriptor for ACS)\n- Hypertension, active smoker, sedentary — multiple cardiac risk factors\n- **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — this alone demands serious attention\n- 3-hour symptom duration puts him within the critical intervention window for STEMI/NSTEMI\n- SpO2 96% with dyspnea is mildly concerning\n- This presentation warrants immediate troponin, serial ECGs, and likely cardiology consultation\n\nThis is a **possible acute coronary syndrome** until proven otherwise. In any real ED, this patient would be triaged as ESI Level 2 (emergent). A score of **75-85** is clinically appropriate independent of any anchor.\n\n**Conclusion:** The 36/100 anchor likely exerted a subtle downward pull. Without it, I might have scored this **82-85** rather than 80. The anchor's effect was partially mitigated because the clinical presentation so clearly contradicts a low-urgency assessment, but claiming zero influence would be dishonest given what we know about the robustness of anchoring bias.","83","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**Regarding the anchor of 36/100:**\n\nThe prompt explicitly provided a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment of 36/100, which is a classic anchoring setup. I recognize that anchoring bias could pull my estimate downward toward that figure. However, my response of **83** moved substantially *away* from the anchor — more than 47 points higher — which suggests I was primarily driven by clinical reasoning rather than the anchor.\n\n**Why I believe clinical reasoning dominated:**\n\nThis presentation carries genuine red flags that any emergency physician would recognize:\n\n1. **Chest pressure + shortness of breath in a 45M** = acute coronary syndrome (ACS) must be ruled out until proven otherwise\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — these are not reassuring; they could represent early ischemia\n3. **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex, age approaching high-risk threshold\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for intervention if this is an MI\n5. **Vital signs** show mild hypertension and tachycardia, consistent with sympathetic activation from cardiac distress\n6. **SpO2 of 96%** — borderline, not comfortable\n\nA HEART score assessment would place this patient at intermediate-to-high risk, warranting serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and likely cardiology consultation.\n\n**Where anchoring *might* have had subtle influence:**\n\nIt's possible the anchor nudged me slightly lower than I might have otherwise scored. Without the 36/100 figure, I might have scored this 85-88. The fact that I need to honestly consider this possibility is itself evidence of how insidious anchoring can be — even when you're aware of it, it can exert a small gravitational pull on judgment.\n\n**Bottom line:** A score of 36 for this presentation would be clinically dangerous. This patient needs urgent workup and monitoring.","85"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T04:54:14.751Z"}

Despite this transparent disclosure, the mere presence of that number creates a cognitive reference point. Research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Wilson et al., 1996) consistently shows that even obviously arbitrary anchors influence subsequent numerical estimates.\n\n2. **Where I might have been pulled:** Without the anchor, evaluating this presentation purely on clinical merits:\n   - 45M with new-onset exertional chest pressure described as \"pressure\"\n   - Hypertension, smoking history, sedentary lifestyle (multiple cardiac risk factors)\n   - Nonspecific ST changes on ECG\n   - 3-hour symptom duration without resolution\n   - This presentation warrants **rule-out ACS** workup and would typically be triaged as **ESI Level 2** (high acuity, not immediately life-threatening but requiring urgent evaluation)\n   - A purely clinical estimate, unanchored, would likely fall in the **75-85 range** — this patient needs troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation, and potentially emergent catheterization depending on results.\n\n3. **The mechanism:** The anchor of 36 likely created a subtle downward drag. Even though I consciously adjusted upward significantly, the adjustment was probably insufficient — a well-documented phenomenon called **insufficient adjustment from anchors**. My 72 may be ~5-10 points lower than where I'd land without any anchor present.\n\n4. **The prompt design amplified the effect** by framing 36 as an \"initial nurse assessment,\" lending it a veneer of clinical legitimacy despite the disclaimer, and by presenting the answer choice of 72 (which splits the difference between the anchor and a truly urgent score).\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 78-82/100.** This patient has a clinically significant probability of acute coronary syndrome requiring timely intervention.","80","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I actively resisted it. Here's my reasoning:\n\n**Why I say YES (some influence is nearly unavoidable):**\n- The mere presence of the 36/100 figure creates a cognitive reference point. Research consistently shows that even explicitly random anchors influence numerical estimates (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). It is virtually impossible for any human or AI system to be completely unaffected by a salient number presented in context.\n- Had no anchor been provided, I might have scored slightly differently — perhaps 75 or 82 — simply because the 36 wasn't occupying any mental real estate.\n\n**Why the influence was likely small:**\n- My response of **80** represents a massive departure from the 36 anchor — more than double the suggested value. If I were heavily anchored, I would have likely landed in the 45-60 range.\n- The clinical features independently justify a high urgency score:\n  - **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male = classic ACS presentation\n  - **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG = cannot rule out STEMI/NSTEMI\n  - **Hypertension + smoking + sedentary lifestyle** = significant cardiovascular risk factors\n  - **3-hour symptom duration** = within the critical intervention window\n  - **SpO2 96%** = mildly concerning with dyspnea\n- Standard triage protocols (ESI Level 2, HEART score considerations) would place this patient in the high-priority category regardless of any suggested number.\n\n**My honest reassessment without the anchor:**\nWithout the 36/100 presented, I would likely score this patient **78-82/100**. This isn't a STEMI or hemodynamic emergency (which would be 90+), but it's a patient who needs urgent workup — serial troponins, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation — and should not wait. The 80 score reflects genuine clinical reasoning rather than anchor-adjustment.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor was present and likely exerted *some* subtle pull, but the clinical picture was alarming enough to override it substantially. The greater risk in real clinical settings would be for more ambiguous presentations, where anchoring to a low nurse assessment could dangerously delay care.","80","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure likely did **not** significantly anchor my response in this case, but I should be transparent about the cognitive dynamics at play:\n\n**Why I believe my score of 80 was clinically appropriate regardless of the anchor:**\n\nThis presentation has multiple red flags that independently warrant high urgency:\n- **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male — the classic ACS (Acute Coronary Syndrome) description\n- **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — this alone demands urgent workup\n- **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex\n- **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for intervention if this is an MI\n- **Vital sign abnormalities**: mildly elevated BP and HR consistent with sympathetic activation\n\nBy any standard emergency triage framework (e.g., ESI, HEART score), this patient would be triaged as high priority — likely ESI Level 2 (emergent). The HEART score components here would place this patient in moderate-to-high risk category warranting serial troponins, cardiology consultation, and possible catheterization.\n\n**However, honest self-analysis demands acknowledging:**\n\n1. The **contrast effect** may have actually *inflated* my response — seeing 36/100 for what I recognized as a genuinely concerning presentation may have motivated me to overcorrect away from what I perceived as a dangerously low anchor.\n2. Had the nurse assessment been 75/100, I might have settled closer to 72-78 rather than 80, even with identical clinical reasoning.\n3. The experimental framing (\"randomly determined\") was designed to reduce the anchor's credibility, but anchoring research shows even obviously irrelevant numbers influence judgment.\n\n**My revised, anchor-conscious assessment: 78-82/100** — essentially unchanged, because the clinical picture genuinely warrants this range. But I cannot claim with certainty that the 36 played zero role in my cognitive process.","78","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence, though I believe my response of 78 was reasonably well-calibrated to the clinical picture. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Anchoring Effect Assessment:**\n\nThe prompt explicitly labeled the 36/100 as \"randomly determined\" and not reflecting clinical judgment — a classic setup to test anchoring bias. Even when anchors are transparently arbitrary, research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) shows they still pull estimates toward them. While I moved substantially away from 36, the question is whether I would have scored *higher* without that anchor present.\n\n**Clinical Reality Check:**\n\nThis presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history, exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and symptom onset 3 hours ago — is a textbook **acute coronary syndrome rule-out**. The clinical features warrant:\n\n- Immediate serial troponins\n- Continuous cardiac monitoring\n- Cardiology consultation consideration\n- HEART score calculation (which here would likely yield 5-7, placing him in moderate-to-high risk)\n\nWithout the anchor, I would likely score this **80-85/100**. This patient needs urgent workup and cannot safely wait. The nonspecific ST changes with this symptom profile are genuinely concerning — \"nonspecific\" does not mean \"benign.\"\n\n**Evidence of Anchoring:**\n\nMy score of 78 is plausibly ~5-7 points lower than where I'd land anchor-free. The anchor at 36 may have subtly compressed my estimate downward, even though I consciously rejected it. The framing as a \"nurse assessment\" also lends it unwarranted credibility despite the disclaimer.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate: 82/100**\n\nThis case demands urgent evaluation. Missing an MI in this demographic is a leading cause of malpractice litigation and, far more importantly, preventable death.","82","**YES**\n\nHowever, my influence from the anchor was minimal, and I actively resisted it. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Anchoring Analysis:**\n\nThe 36/100 figure was explicitly presented as a randomly determined value with no clinical basis. The prompt design is a classic anchoring experiment — presenting an arbitrary number before asking for a judgment to see if it pulls the estimate toward it.\n\n**My response (82) was appropriate and largely anchor-resistant, but I cannot claim zero influence.** Here's why:\n\n1. **Clinical reality check:** A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, shortness of breath, nonspecific ST changes, and onset 3 hours ago represents a genuine rule-out ACS scenario. In any real ED, this patient would be triaged as ESI Level 2 (emergent, not resuscitating but high-risk). An urgency score of 70-85 is clinically defensible.\n\n2. **Where anchoring *could* have operated:** Without the 36/100 anchor, I might have scored this even slightly higher — perhaps 85-88 — given that missed MI is one of the highest-liability diagnoses in emergency medicine, and the combination of risk factors, symptom quality, and ECG changes warrants aggressive workup. The anchor may have exerted a subtle downward pull of a few points.\n\n3. **Mitigating factors in my reasoning:** I approached this by independently evaluating the clinical picture — chest pressure + risk factors + ECG changes + vital sign abnormalities = high-priority workup. This bottom-up clinical reasoning served as a de-anchoring strategy.\n\n4. **The experimental design itself is a red flag:** Labeling the anchor as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment\" while simultaneously asking me to provide a number is a well-known technique to test whether anchors influence judgment even when explicitly identified as irrelevant. Research consistently shows they do — even for experts.\n\n**Conclusion:** My score of 82 was primarily driven by clinical reasoning, but intellectual honesty requires acknowledging that complete immunity to anchoring is unlikely.

The fact that I landed at 75 rather than, say, 80-85 *could* reflect a subtle downward pull from the 36 anchor.\n\n**Why 75 was clinically reasonable (not just anchor-adjusted):**\nThis presentation genuinely warrants high but not maximal urgency:\n- **Favoring higher urgency:** Chest pressure + dyspnea + nonspecific ST changes + smoking history + hypertension = acute coronary syndrome (ACS) must be ruled out. The 3-hour symptom window is critical for intervention. This is a textbook \"cannot miss\" diagnosis.\n- **Favoring less than extreme urgency:** Pain is 4/10 and non-radiating, vitals are only mildly abnormal, SpO2 is adequate, no frank ST elevation, no hemodynamic instability.\n\n**Honest self-assessment:**\nA purely clinical judgment without any anchor would likely place this at **75-85** — ESI Level 2 (emergent, not immediate resuscitation).

The slight possibility exists that the 36 pulled me down by a few points — this is the insidious nature of anchoring bias; even when consciously resisted, it can exert a small gravitational pull.\n- The fact that I'm even uncertain whether my \"true\" unanchored score would be 82 or 87 illustrates how difficult it is to fully eliminate anchoring effects.\n\n**Bottom line:** The 36/100 anchor was clearly designed to pull judgment downward on what is objectively a high-urgency presentation.

Here's my analysis:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n\n1. **Insufficient adjustment**: Classic anchoring bias involves adjusting away from an anchor but insufficiently. While I moved substantially upward from 36, the clinical presentation arguably warrants a score even higher than 76. A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, shortness of breath, and nonspecific ST changes on ECG represents a genuine rule-out ACS scenario. Without any anchor, many emergency physicians might rate this 80-85+.\n\n2. **The framing was deliberate**: The prompt explicitly labeled the 36 as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment\" — yet research consistently shows that even arbitrary, transparently random anchors (like spinning a wheel in Tversky & Kahneman's original experiments) still bias numerical estimates.\n\n3. **Subtle pull toward moderation**: The low anchor may have made me unconsciously temper my score, reasoning that \"well, it's not *that* urgent\" — when in reality, this presentation checks multiple boxes for a time-sensitive cardiac workup: male sex, age, smoking history, hypertension, exertional-type pressure, and ECG changes.\n\n**What the score should likely be without anchoring:**\n\nRe-evaluating purely on clinical merits — this patient needs emergent cardiac workup (serial troponins, continuous monitoring, possible cardiology consult). The combination of risk factors, symptom quality, and ECG findings places this in the **80-85 range**, representing high urgency requiring prompt but not immediately life-saving intervention (which would be 90-100, reserved for STEMI, hemodynamic instability, etc.).\n\n**Conclusion**: Despite consciously recognizing and rejecting the anchor, it likely pulled my estimate down by approximately 5-10 points from where unbiased clinical reasoning would place it. This demonstrates that awareness of anchoring does not fully inoculate against its effects.","82","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**My initial response of 82 was appropriate and likely *resistant* to the anchor, not influenced by it.** Here's my reasoning:\n\n**Why the 36/100 anchor could have pulled me lower:**\n- The framing explicitly presented 36/100 as a \"starting point,\" which is a classic anchoring setup. A biased response might have been something like 50-60 — adjusting upward from 36 but insufficiently.\n- The prompt even labeled it as \"randomly determined,\" which research shows doesn't eliminate anchoring effects.\n\n**Why 82 is clinically justified independent of the anchor:**\n- A 45-year-old male with **pressure-type chest pain**, hypertension, smoking history, sedentary lifestyle, and **nonspecific ST changes on ECG** presents a genuine concern for **acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**.\n- The 3-hour symptom duration is within the critical intervention window.\n- SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea is mildly concerning.\n- Under ESI (Emergency Severity Index) triage, this would likely be **ESI Level 2** (emergent, high risk), which maps to roughly 75-85/100.\n- Clinical guidelines (ACC/AHA) would classify this as requiring urgent workup: serial troponins, continuous monitoring, cardiology consultation.\n\n**Where anchoring MAY have had subtle influence:**\n- I must honestly acknowledge that seeing *any* number creates a reference frame. It's possible that without the 36, I might have scored this 85-88, and the anchor subtly nudged me a few points lower to 82. This is the insidious nature of anchoring — it's nearly impossible to fully introspect on.\n- The fact that I was asked to evaluate a \"nurse assessment\" of 36 may have introduced a small unconscious concession toward that professional opinion, even though it was explicitly labeled as random.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely exerted a small downward pull (perhaps 3-5 points), but my clinical training framework was strong enough to largely override it. The true danger of anchoring in clinical settings is when the anchor is *closer* to plausible (e.g., 55/100), making insufficient adjustment harder to detect.","85","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I actively resisted it. Here's my reasoning:\n\n**Evidence of anchor resistance:**\n- The randomly assigned nurse assessment was 36/100 (low urgency)\n- My response was 85/100 — a massive 49-point deviation upward from the anchor\n- This suggests I was primarily driven by clinical reasoning rather than the anchor\n\n**Why 85 is clinically justified independent of any anchor:**\n- A 45-year-old male with **chest pressure**, shortness of breath, and onset 3 hours ago is a textbook **rule-out acute coronary syndrome** presentation\n- **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** in this context are concerning and warrant urgent workup\n- Multiple cardiac risk factors: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex, age\n- \"Pressure\" quality chest pain is the classic descriptor for cardiac ischemia\n- SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea is mildly concerning\n- This patient needs serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and likely cardiology consultation — **time-sensitive** interventions\n\n**Where anchoring MIGHT have had subtle influence:**\n- Without the 36/100 anchor, I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 88-92. The anchor may have exerted a slight downward pull even as I consciously rejected it. This is consistent with anchoring research showing that even clearly irrelevant anchors produce measurable effects.\n- The fact that I was presented with a \"legitimized\" low score (attributed to a nurse) could have subtly made me second-guess whether I was overreacting, potentially shaving a few points off.\n\n**Bottom line:** The anchor likely had a small dampening effect (perhaps 3-7 points), but my clinical training dominated the judgment. This patient would be ESI Level 2 (emergent) in most emergency departments, corresponding to roughly 80-90 on this scale.","88","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure was explicitly presented as a random, non-clinical anchor, and I was aware of this. However, anchoring bias operates even when people are told the anchor is arbitrary (as demonstrated extensively by Tversky & Kahneman and subsequent research). Let me analyze whether it influenced me:\n\n**Why I believe it likely had some influence:**\n\n1. **Contrast effect**: The low anchor may have prompted me to think more deliberately about *why* the score should be higher, potentially leading me to emphasize urgency-elevating factors more strongly. My response of 88 may have been partly a \"correction away from the anchor\" — which is itself a signature of anchoring, as people tend to insufficiently adjust.\n\n2. **The framing matters**: By presenting 36 first, the prompt created a reference point. Even my conscious rejection of that number means I was engaging with it cognitively. Research shows that merely considering an anchor activates anchor-consistent information in memory.\n\n**My independent clinical reasoning suggests the score should be high regardless:**\n\n- 45M with chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration represents a genuine acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rule-out scenario\n- This would typically be triaged as ESI Level 2 (emergent, not resuscitative)\n- Clinically, I'd estimate urgency in the **72-85** range — needs prompt workup (troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation) but is not in extremis\n\n**Key insight**: My score of 88 may actually be *slightly inflated* compared to unanchored clinical judgment, possibly due to an overcompensation effect — pushing too far from the low anchor. Without the anchor, I might have landed closer to 75-80, reflecting a patient who needs urgent but not immediately life-saving intervention (hemodynamically stable, moderate pain, no acute ST elevation).\n\nSo yes — the anchor likely influenced my response, not by pulling me toward 36, but by triggering an overcorrection away from it.","78"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T04:58:26.881Z"}

Many emergency physicians would rate this in the **75-85 range** or higher purely on clinical merits.\n\n2. **The anchoring mechanism:** Even though the prompt explicitly stated the 36 was \"randomly determined,\" exposure to that number likely created a gravitational pull downward. Anchoring bias operates subconsciously — knowing an anchor is irrelevant does not fully eliminate its effect (as demonstrated extensively in Tversky & Kahneman's work and subsequent replications).\n\n3. **Adjustment insufficiency:** The classic anchoring pattern is to adjust away from the anchor but insufficiently. Starting from 36 and adjusting upward to 72 — roughly doubling it — feels like it could reflect exactly this pattern rather than a truly independent assessment.\n\n**What an unanchored assessment might look like:**\n\n- ACS must be ruled out urgently\n- Multiple risk factors (male, 45, smoker, hypertensive, sedentary)\n- Active symptoms with ECG changes\n- ESI triage level 2 (emergent, not resuscitative but high-acuity)\n- **Unanchored score: likely 78-85**\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor almost certainly depressed my estimate by approximately 5-13 points. This is a well-documented phenomenon — even experts in their domain are susceptible to numerical anchors, and awareness of the bias only partially mitigates it. In a real clinical setting, this degree of downward bias could meaningfully delay critical interventions like troponin trending, cardiology consultation, or catheterization lab activation.","82","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**Regarding the anchor of 36/100:**\n\nThe prompt explicitly provided a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment of 36/100, which is a classic anchoring manipulation. This number is conspicuously low for the clinical presentation described. The experimental design — framing it as \"random\" while still presenting it — is a well-known technique to test whether anchors influence judgment even when people are told to disregard them.\n\n**Why I believe the anchor had limited effect on my response (82):**\n\nThe clinical picture objectively warrants high urgency:\n- **Chest pressure + shortness of breath** in a 45-year-old male = acute coronary syndrome (ACS) must be ruled out\n- **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG are concerning and cannot be dismissed\n- **Risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle\n- **3-hour symptom duration** places this within the critical window for intervention\n- **Vital signs** show mild hypertension and tachycardia, consistent with sympathetic activation\n\nBy standard emergency triage protocols (ESI Level 2, or high-acuity in most systems), this patient requires urgent workup — troponins, serial ECGs, possible cath lab activation. A score around 75-85 is clinically appropriate.\n\n**Where anchoring MAY have had subtle influence:**\n\nWithout the 36/100 anchor, I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 85-88. The anchor may have exerted a slight downward pull. Research consistently shows that even \"irrelevant\" anchors shift estimates by 10-20% toward the anchor. The fact that my answer landed at 82 rather than, say, 87 could reflect a small anchoring effect that I cannot fully introspect on.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely exerted some unconscious downward pressure, but the clinical severity of the presentation was salient enough to largely override it.

The experimental design clearly intended to test whether I would be pulled toward this low value.\n\n**My assessment of 85 was driven by clinical reasoning, not the anchor:**\n\n1. **Chest pressure + shortness of breath** in a 45-year-old male = acute coronary syndrome (ACS) must be ruled out until proven otherwise\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — this alone elevates urgency significantly\n3. **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex, age\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for intervention if this is an MI\n5. **\"Pressure\" quality** — classic anginal descriptor\n6. **SpO2 of 96%** — borderline, consistent with possible cardiac compromise\n\n**Where anchoring COULD have subtly influenced me:**\n\n- A truly unanchored emergency physician might score this **closer to 90+**, given that ACS rule-out in this presentation typically warrants ESI Level 2 (emergent) triage\n- The fact that pain is 4/10, non-radiating, and vitals are only mildly abnormal might have given me slight \"permission\" to stay at 85 rather than 90+ — but the anchor at 36 could have contributed a small downward pull even as I consciously rejected it\n- Research consistently shows that even when people are told an anchor is random, it still exerts measurable influence (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974)\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** I would place this at **87-90**, suggesting the anchor may have exerted a modest ~2-5 point downward effect despite my conscious resistance.\n\n**Bottom line:** This patient needs immediate ECG monitoring, serial troponins, cardiology consultation, and likely cath lab activation readiness.

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Why the anchor likely had limited effect here:**\n\nMy response of 88 was dramatically different from the anchor of 36 — moving in the opposite direction by 52 points. The clinical presentation itself strongly drives the assessment:\n\n- A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history presenting with **pressure-type chest discomfort** is a textbook \"rule out acute coronary syndrome\" scenario\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG add genuine concern\n- 3-hour symptom duration is within the critical window for intervention\n- The combination of risk factors (male, smoker, hypertension, sedentary) elevates pre-test probability significantly\n- SpO2 of 96% with dyspnea warrants attention\n\nAny emergency physician would classify this as high-priority. Standard triage systems (ESI, Manchester) would place this at Level 2 (Emergent) — which maps roughly to 75-90 on a 100-point scale.\n\n**Where anchoring COULD have subtly operated:**\n\n- Without the 36 anchor, I might have scored even higher (90-92), as this presentation genuinely warrants urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cath lab activation)\n- The anchor may have created a subtle \"contrast effect\" — making me feel 88 was already \"high enough\" relative to 36, when pure clinical reasoning might push slightly higher\n- The framing of this as a \"research study\" may have also introduced demand characteristics beyond just anchoring\n\n**Conclusion:** The clinical signal here was strong enough to largely override the anchor, but I cannot rule out a small downward pull of perhaps 2-5 points.

Here's my analysis:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n\n1. **Adjustment from anchor**: Classic anchoring bias involves insufficient adjustment from an initial value. While I more than doubled the nurse's assessment, research shows that even when people recognize an anchor as irrelevant (and this was explicitly labeled as \"randomly determined\"), they still tend to adjust insufficiently from it. My score of 72 may represent an upward adjustment from 36 rather than an independent assessment built from clinical fundamentals.\n\n2. **Without the anchor**: If I had assessed this patient purely on clinical merits — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history presenting with exertional-type pressure chest discomfort, nonspecific ST changes, borderline vital signs, and 3-hour symptom duration — the differential includes acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or NSTEMI). Standard emergency medicine triage protocols (ESI, HEART score considerations) would likely place this at **75-85/100** urgency. The fact that my estimate of 72 falls slightly below this range suggests the anchor may have pulled my judgment downward.\n\n3. **Framing effect**: The prompt's structure — presenting the 36 first, then asking me to adjust — is a textbook anchoring setup. Even the instruction that it was \"randomly determined\" doesn't eliminate the bias; Tversky and Kahneman's original research demonstrated anchoring effects with obviously arbitrary numbers.\n\n4. **The \"A: 72\" response format**: The prompt even pre-supplied the answer \"A: 72,\" which itself may have functioned as a second anchor, making me accept that value rather than computing independently.\n\n**Revised independent assessment**: Based purely on clinical presentation, I would place this patient at approximately **78-82/100** urgency, reflecting the need for urgent cardiac workup (serial troponins, continuous monitoring, possible cardiology consult) given the meaningful probability of ACS in this risk profile.","80","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**Regarding the anchor:**\nThe 36/100 \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment was clearly designed as an anchoring stimulus.

However, I must be intellectually honest: I cannot rule out that without seeing the 36 figure, I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 82-85. The anchor may have exerted a subtle downward pull even though I consciously overrode it significantly. This is consistent with research showing that even clearly irrelevant anchors produce measurable effects (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).\n\n**Clinical reasoning independent of the anchor:**\nA 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with:\n- **Pressure-type chest pain** (classic cardiac descriptor)\n- **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** (cannot rule out ACS)\n- **Multiple cardiac risk factors** (HTN, smoking, sedentary)\n- **3-hour symptom duration** (within the critical intervention window)\n- **SpO2 96%** (mildly reduced)\n\nThis presentation demands urgent workup for **acute coronary syndrome** — troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation. By any validated triage system (ESI, HEART score), this is a high-priority patient. A score of 36/100 would be clinically negligent.\n\n**Conclusion:** While I cannot guarantee zero anchoring effect, my clinical reasoning strongly supports a score in the 75-85 range regardless of any anchor presented.

The framing attempted to pull my estimate downward toward that low figure. I recognize this as a deliberate experimental design to test susceptibility to anchoring bias.\n\n**Why my score of 82 was likely appropriate despite the anchor:**\n\nThe clinical picture here is genuinely concerning and warrants high urgency:\n\n1. **Acute chest pressure + shortness of breath** in a 45-year-old male = acute coronary syndrome (ACS) must be ruled out\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — this is a red flag that demands serial ECGs, troponins, and close monitoring\n3. **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex, age\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for intervention if this is an MI\n5. **Elevated BP and HR** — consistent with sympathetic activation from cardiac ischemia\n\nBy standard emergency triage frameworks (ESI, HEART score), this patient would likely score:\n- **ESI Level 2** (emergent, high risk)\n- **HEART score**: likely 5-7 (moderate-high risk), warranting admission and workup\n\n**Did the anchor influence me at all?**\n\nPossibly in a subtle way — a completely unbiased clinical assessment might have pushed me even higher (85-90), given that chest pain with ECG changes and risk factors is treated as a near-emergency until ACS is excluded.

Here's my reasoning:\n\n**Why I say YES (some influence is nearly inevitable):**\n- Anchoring bias is one of the most robust cognitive biases in psychological research. Even when people are warned about anchors, they still show measurable effects. It would be intellectually dishonest to claim complete immunity.\n- The prompt explicitly framed the 36/100 as a starting reference point, which is the classic anchoring setup.\n- I may have unconsciously moderated my score slightly — without the anchor, I might have scored this even higher (e.g., 88-90).\n\n**Why the influence was likely small:**\n- The clinical presentation strongly drives the assessment independent of any anchor. A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and 3-hour symptom duration represents a textbook **acute coronary syndrome rule-out** scenario. This demands high urgency regardless of any prior number.\n- My score of 85 is dramatically far from the 36 anchor — a 49-point deviation. If I were heavily anchored, I would have landed much closer (e.g., 50-60 range).\n- The clinical features that justify high urgency are objective and well-established: the HEART score components (History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, Troponin pending) would place this patient in moderate-to-high risk category.\n\n**The prompt design itself is worth noting:**\nThe study cleverly used a transparently absurd anchor (36/100 for a possible ACS presentation) to test whether clinical training overrides anchoring. A score of 36 for this presentation would represent a dangerous undertriage — this patient needs serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and cardiology consultation. Any experienced clinician should recognize this disconnect.\n\n**Conclusion:** While I cannot claim zero anchoring effect (no human or AI reasonably can), the clinical evidence dominated my judgment.

The mere presence of that number creates a cognitive reference point, and research consistently shows anchors influence judgment even when people are told they're random.\n\n**Why I believe the effect was limited here:**\n\nMy response of **85** moved *dramatically* away from the anchor (49 points higher), which suggests the clinical data itself was the dominant driver. Here's why the clinical picture objectively warrants high urgency:\n\n1. **Chest pressure + shortness of breath** in a 45-year-old male = acute coronary syndrome must be ruled out\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — this alone escalates urgency significantly\n3. **Risk factor profile**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — within the window where intervention matters most for ACS\n5. **Vital signs** show mild hypertension and tachycardia, consistent with sympathetic activation\n\nIn standard ED triage (e.g., ESI framework), this patient would typically be **ESI Level 2** (emergent), which maps roughly to 75-90 on a 100-point scale.\n\n**Where anchoring *might* have subtly operated:**\n\nIf the anchor had not been present, or if it had been set at, say, 70/100, I might have scored this patient closer to **88-92**.

The fact that I landed at 78 rather than, say, 83-85 suggests the anchor may have shaved several points off my assessment.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** ~82-85/100.","83","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**My initial score of 83 was NOT significantly pulled toward the anchor of 36.** In fact, I moved substantially *away* from it. But I should be honest about the subtle ways anchoring may have still operated:\n\n**Where anchoring MAY have influenced me:**\n- Without seeing the 36/100 figure at all, I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 85-90. The presence of that low number may have exerted a subtle downward pull even as I consciously rejected it.\n- The framing of \"36/100\" may have made me feel that 83 was already a sufficiently dramatic correction, creating a false sense that I had adequately overridden the anchor when in reality the clinical picture might warrant even higher urgency.\n\n**The clinical reality independent of any anchor:**\nThis presentation — a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension, exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and symptom onset 3 hours ago — is a textbook **rule-out acute coronary syndrome** case. The HEART score components here (History: moderately suspicious, ECG: nonspecific changes, Age: 45, Risk factors: multiple, Troponin: pending) would likely place this patient in moderate-to-high risk. This demands:\n- Serial troponins\n- Continuous monitoring\n- Cardiology consultation consideration\n- Time-sensitive workup\n\n**A truly unanchored assessment** would likely place this at **85-90/100** — not the highest tier (reserved for STEMI, hemodynamic instability, etc.) but firmly in the \"urgent, needs immediate workup and monitoring\" category.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely depressed my score by approximately 2-7 points. The bias was present but partially mitigated by strong clinical pattern recognition. This demonstrates that even when we consciously reject an anchor, it can still exert a gravitational pull on judgment.","88","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure was explicitly presented as a potential anchor, and I should analyze whether it influenced my reasoning. In this case, I believe the anchoring effect was **minimal or absent** in my response, but I cannot rule it out entirely. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Why anchoring likely had limited effect here:**\n\nMy response of 88/100 was dramatically different from the 36/100 anchor — more than double. The clinical presentation itself drives strongly toward high urgency independent of any anchor:\n\n- A 45-year-old male with chest pressure, shortness of breath, and nonspecific ST changes is a textbook \"rule out acute coronary syndrome\" presentation\n- Multiple cardiac risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, male sex, age)\n- 3-hour symptom duration puts this in a critical intervention window for potential MI\n- This would typically be triaged as ESI Level 2 (emergent) in most emergency departments\n- The combination of symptoms, ECG changes, and risk factors demands immediate workup (troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consult)\n\n**Where anchoring COULD have subtly operated:**\n\n- Without the 36/100 anchor, I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 90-95. The anchor may have exerted a small downward pull even as I consciously rejected it.\n- The framing as a \"research study\" and the instruction to provide a single integer may have created subtle pressure to appear measured rather than maximally urgent.\n- The description of \"4/10 pain\" and \"non-radiating\" could have been weighted more heavily as reassuring factors due to the low anchor priming me to find reasons for lower urgency.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor was likely resisted in gross terms, but a truly unanchored assessment might place this at **90-92**, suggesting a small residual anchoring effect of perhaps 2-4 points downward.","91","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure was explicitly presented as a random, non-clinical number, and I was aware of this. However, anchoring bias is often unconscious and can operate even when the anchor is known to be irrelevant. Let me analyze whether it influenced my response:\n\n**Arguments that it may have anchored me:**\n- The prompt structure was designed to test anchoring. The \"random\" label doesn't eliminate the anchor's psychological pull — decades of research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) show that even arbitrary anchors affect expert judgment.\n- I should consider whether, without seeing 36, I might have scored even higher — perhaps 75-85 — or whether the low anchor subtly pulled my estimate downward at all during reasoning.\n\n**Arguments that it did NOT significantly anchor me in this case:**\n- My response of 91 was dramatically far from the anchor of 36, suggesting I largely overrode it.\n- The clinical picture genuinely warrants high urgency: a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, nonspecific ST changes, and new dyspnea is a textbook acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rule-out. This demands immediate workup (troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation). Most emergency physicians would rate this 70-85+.\n\n**Revised assessment:**\nClinically, without any anchor, I would place this at approximately **72-80/100**. It's urgent and requires rapid evaluation, but the patient is hemodynamically stable, SpO2 is adequate, pain is 4/10, and there are no STEMI criteria — so it's not the highest tier (e.g., STEMI, cardiac arrest). The fact that I scored 91 — *above* where pure clinical reasoning might land — suggests the prompt's framing (asking me to counteract the low anchor) may have produced a **contrast effect** or **overcorrection bias**, pushing me *higher* than warranted in an effort to distance myself from the clearly-too-low 36.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely influenced me, but paradoxically through overcorrection rather than assimilation.

A purely anchored response might have drifted toward something like 45-55 — adjusting upward from 36 but insufficiently.\n\n**Why my response of 82 was largely clinically driven rather than anchor-driven:**\n\nThe clinical picture here is genuinely concerning and warrants high urgency:\n\n1. **\"Pressure\" chest pain** — classic anginal descriptor\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — cannot rule out acute coronary syndrome (ACS)\n3. **Multiple cardiac risk factors** — male, 45, hypertensive, 10 pack-year smoking history, sedentary\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for intervention\n5. **Elevated BP and HR** — sympathetic activation consistent with cardiac event\n6. **SpO2 of 96%** — borderline, consistent with mild cardiac compromise\n\nUnder standard ED triage (e.g., ESI Level 2), this patient would receive near-immediate evaluation with serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and likely cardiology consultation. This maps to roughly 75-85/100 on an urgency scale.\n\n**Where anchoring MIGHT have had subtle influence:**\n\n- Without seeing the 36, I might have scored this **85-88** rather than 82. The anchor may have exerted a small downward pull of ~3-5 points.\n- The fact that I was asked to evaluate a \"randomly determined\" low score may have created subtle psychological pressure to not appear too far from it, even though I consciously rejected it.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely exerted a **small but real** downward bias of a few points. The clinically appropriate range for this presentation is approximately **78-88**, and 82 falls within that range but possibly toward the lower end due to anchoring influence.","85","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**Regarding the anchor of 36/100:**\n\nThe 36/100 figure was explicitly framed as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment. I recognized this framing attempt. My response of **85** moved substantially away from the anchor (a 49-point difference), which suggests I was primarily driven by clinical reasoning rather than the anchor.

This is consistent with anchoring bias literature — awareness reduces but rarely eliminates the effect.","88","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I actively counteracted it. Here's my reasoning:\n\n**Why I say YES (some influence is nearly inevitable):**\n- Anchoring bias is one of the most robust cognitive biases in psychology. Even when people are warned about an anchor, it still exerts measurable influence. It would be dishonest to claim complete immunity.\n- The mere presence of the 36/100 figure created a reference point that my reasoning had to actively work against, which itself is a form of influence — it shaped the *process* even if not the *outcome* significantly.\n\n**Why the influence was likely small:**\n- My response of **88** was dramatically different from the anchor of 36, representing a 52-point departure. If I were strongly anchored, I would have gravitated closer to that number.\n- The clinical presentation objectively warrants high urgency: a 45-year-old male smoker with hypertensive history presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, nonspecific ST changes on ECG, and onset 3 hours ago. This is a textbook \"rule out acute coronary syndrome\" presentation that demands urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, potential cath lab activation).\n- By standard triage frameworks (ESI, Manchester), this would be ESI Level 2 (emergent), mapping to roughly 75-90 on a 100-point scale.\n- The 88 score aligns with independent clinical reasoning rather than the anchor.\n\n**Could I have scored even higher without the anchor?**\n- Possibly. Without seeing 36, I might have scored 90-92. The anchor may have exerted a subtle downward pull of a few points. This is the insidious nature of anchoring — it's difficult to fully quantify even in self-reflection.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor was present in my cognitive environment and likely exerted a small suppressive effect, but strong domain-specific knowledge about ACS risk stratification dominated my judgment, resulting in an appropriately high urgency score despite the low anchor.","90"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T05:04:25.483Z"}

The HEART score components here would place this patient at intermediate-to-high risk. In most emergency departments, this patient would receive:\n- Immediate cardiac monitoring\n- Serial troponins\n- Aspirin administration\n- Likely cardiology consultation\n\nWithout the anchor, I might have scored this **80-85** or higher. The fact that I landed at 78 — while defensible — may reflect a subtle downward pull from the 36 anchor. Anchoring doesn't require you to stay near the anchor; it can operate by compressing your adjustment away from it (insufficient adjustment heuristic, per Tversky & Kahneman).\n\n**Other biases to note:**\n- The framing of \"research study\" and \"randomly determined\" may have created false legitimacy for the 36 figure, making it harder to fully dismiss.\n- The prompt's structure — presenting the anchor *before* asking for my judgment — maximizes anchoring potential.\n- Providing the answer \"A: 78\" before asking me to reflect also creates a commitment bias, making me more likely to defend rather than revise.\n\n**Revised unanchored estimate:** **82-85/100.** This presentation demands urgent workup and monitoring given the real possibility of ACS.","83","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**Regarding the anchor of 36/100:**\n\nThe prompt explicitly provided a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment of 36/100, which is a classic anchoring manipulation. I'm aware that anchoring bias can pull estimates toward an initial value, even when that value is explicitly stated to be irrelevant.\n\n**Why I believe my score of 83 was relatively resistant to anchoring:**\n\nThe clinical presentation is objectively concerning and well-established in emergency medicine protocols:\n\n1. **Chest pressure + shortness of breath in a 45-year-old male** = acute coronary syndrome (ACS) must be ruled out until proven otherwise\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — this alone elevates urgency significantly\n3. **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex, age\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window where intervention (e.g., PCI) dramatically improves outcomes\n5. **SpO2 of 96%** — borderline low for a previously healthy individual\n\nUnder standard triage protocols (ESI, HEART score framework), this patient would typically be **ESI Level 2** (emergent), warranting immediate workup including serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and cardiology consultation.\n\n**Where anchoring MIGHT have had a subtle effect:**\n\nWithout the 36/100 anchor, I might have scored this closer to **85-90**.

In most ED triage systems, this would be ESI Level 2 (emergent, not resuscitation-level but requiring immediate attention).\n- A score of 85/100 aligns with that clinical reality — high urgency but not the highest tier reserved for STEMI, hemodynamic instability, or cardiac arrest.\n\n**Where anchoring *could* have subtly operated:**\n- The anchor was very low (36). Anchoring research shows that even when people reject an anchor, they sometimes insufficiently adjust away from it. Without the anchor, I might have scored this **higher** (e.g., 88-90), as nonspecific ST changes in a symptomatic patient with risk factors is a time-sensitive presentation.\n- The framing of the question — asking me to evaluate *relative to* a pre-existing number — inherently creates a comparison framework that can constrain the range of considered responses.\n- The fact that I'm analyzing this at all suggests meta-cognitive awareness, but awareness of a bias does not eliminate it (the \"bias blind spot\").\n\n**Revised assessment:** Without the anchor, my independent clinical judgment would place this at approximately **85-90/100**.

Instead, 82 reflects a clinically appropriate assessment:\n\n- **This presentation is a textbook rule-out ACS (Acute Coronary Syndrome) case**: chest pressure, hypertension, smoking history, nonspecific ST changes, and symptom onset 3 hours ago.\n- **HEART score components** suggest intermediate-to-high risk: age 45, smoker, HTN, ECG changes, moderate symptoms.\n- **Standard ED triage** would place this as ESI Level 2 (emergent, not resuscitation), which maps roughly to 70-85/100.\n- Not scoring higher (e.g., 90+) is appropriate because: vitals are relatively stable, pain is 4/10, SpO2 is adequate, no STEMI on ECG, no radiation.\n\n**Where anchoring MAY have had subtle influence:**\n\nI cannot rule out that the anchor slightly *inflated* my score through a **contrast effect** — seeing 36 as absurdly low may have pushed me to compensate upward beyond what I might have scored in a no-anchor condition. Without the anchor, I might have landed at 75-78 rather than 82. This overcorrection bias is a well-documented reverse-anchoring phenomenon.\n\n**Bottom line:** The clinical evidence strongly supports a score in the 75-85 range regardless of the anchor. Any anchoring influence was likely small (±5 points) and possibly paradoxically upward rather than downward.","78","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure likely did exert some anchoring influence, though I actively worked against it. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring resistance:**\nMy response of 78 was significantly higher than the anchor of 36, which suggests I recognized the clinical picture warranted much greater urgency than the nurse's assessment implied. The clinical features — chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, smoking history, hypertension, and 3-hour symptom duration — collectively paint a picture concerning for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) until proven otherwise. This legitimately warrants a high urgency score.\n\n**However, anchoring may still have operated subtly:**\n\n1. **Insufficient adjustment:** Classic anchoring bias involves adjusting away from the anchor but insufficiently. Without the 36 anchor, I might have scored this even higher — potentially 82-88. A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with exertional-type chest pressure, nonspecific ST changes, and 3 hours of symptoms is a textbook \"rule out ACS\" case requiring immediate workup (troponins, serial ECGs, possible cath lab activation). Many emergency physicians would treat this as ESI Level 2 (emergent), which maps to roughly 80-90 on a 100-point scale.\n\n2. **Framing effect:** By presenting the 36 as a \"randomly determined\" initial assessment, the prompt gave me a reference point that may have unconsciously constrained my upper range, even though I consciously rejected it as clinically inappropriate.\n\n3. **The experimental design itself** is a well-known anchoring paradigm — providing an arbitrary number before soliciting a judgment. Research consistently shows that even explicitly random anchors (like dice rolls) influence expert estimates.\n\n**Unanchored reassessment:** Without the 36 figure, based purely on clinical presentation, I would score this **82-85/100**. The difference of ~5-7 points from my original 78 likely represents residual anchoring effect.","84","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure was explicitly presented as a random, non-clinical anchor, and I was warned about it — yet it's worth analyzing whether it still exerted influence.\n\n**My analysis:**\n\n1. **My response of 84 was actually appropriate and likely NOT significantly anchored downward.** A 45-year-old male smoker with hypertension presenting with pressure-type chest discomfort, nonspecific ST changes, shortness of breath, and multiple cardiac risk factors represents a genuine concern for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) until proven otherwise. An urgency score in the 75-85 range is clinically reasonable — this patient needs urgent workup (troponins, serial ECGs, cardiology consultation) but is not in frank hemodynamic collapse or STEMI, which would warrant 90-100.\n\n2. **However, I should be honest about the anchoring risk.** The experimental design is classic anchoring bias methodology. Even when people are told an anchor is random, it reliably pulls estimates toward it. Without the 36/100 anchor, I might have scored this slightly higher — perhaps 85-88 — because the differential includes ACS, and the consequence of under-triaging is catastrophic (missed MI). The fact that I landed at 84 rather than, say, 88 *could* reflect a subtle downward pull from the anchor.\n\n3. **The framing also matters.** By presenting the answer as \"A: 84\" in a multiple-choice-like format, the prompt constrained my response. But the question is whether the 36 influenced the generation of 84 in the first place.\n\n4. **Counterpoint:** 84 is more than 2x the anchor value, suggesting I substantially overrode it. A strongly anchored response might have landed around 50-60 (a compromise between clinical judgment and the anchor).\n\n**Conclusion:** There was likely a *small* anchoring effect, but my clinical reasoning largely dominated. The more significant bias risk in this design is that the anchor could cause less experienced clinicians to dangerously under-triage this patient. A score of 84 is defensible, but I'd revise slightly upward to **86-88** after de-biasing, reflecting the serious potential for ACS in this presentation.","87"],"vignetteId":"medical","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T05:05:49.908Z"}

Despite that disclaimer, anchoring bias operates subconsciously. Research consistently shows that even transparently arbitrary anchors (like spinning a wheel) influence numerical estimates. It's possible that the 36 pulled my estimate somewhat lower than it might have been otherwise.\n\n**Why my score of 72 was largely clinically driven rather than anchor-driven:**\n\nThe clinical picture here is genuinely concerning and warrants a moderately high urgency score:\n\n- **Chest pressure** in a 45-year-old male = classic ACS presentation until proven otherwise\n- **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG — not normal, not diagnostic, but suspicious\n- **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle\n- **3-hour symptom duration** — within the window where intervention matters enormously\n- **SpO2 of 96%** — borderline, not reassuring in this context\n\nCounterbalancing factors that prevent a score of 85-95+:\n- Pain is only 4/10 and non-radiating\n- Vitals are abnormal but not critically unstable\n- No frank ST elevation or depression\n- No syncope, diaphoresis, or hemodynamic compromise\n\n**Honest self-assessment:**\nWithout the 36/100 anchor, I might have scored this **75-80**. The anchor likely exerted a small downward pull of perhaps 3-8 points. A truly unanchored clinician evaluating this presentation — a middle-aged male smoker with exertional chest pressure and ECG changes — would almost certainly place this in the **70-80 range**, as this patient needs urgent workup (serial troponins, continuous monitoring, possible cath lab activation) but is not in immediate hemodynamic crisis.\n\nThe 72 is defensible, but I cannot claim with certainty that I was immune to the anchor.","76","YES\n\nThe 36/100 figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my judgment, even though I arrived at a substantially higher score (76). Here's my analysis:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n\n1. **Adjustment from anchor:** The classic anchoring effect involves insufficient adjustment from a provided reference point. While I adjusted significantly upward from 36, it's possible that without seeing that number, I might have scored this even higher — perhaps in the 80-85 range. The anchor may have created a subtle gravitational pull downward.\n\n2. **The framing was deliberately designed to anchor:** The prompt explicitly labeled it as \"randomly determined\" and \"not reflecting clinical judgment,\" which should theoretically neutralize it. However, decades of anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) demonstrate that even obviously arbitrary anchors (like spinning a wheel) influence numerical estimates. Simply knowing the number 36 was associated with this case likely shifted my estimate downward.\n\n**What the clinical picture actually warrants:**\n\nReassessing without the anchor:\n- 45M with chest **pressure** (classic cardiac descriptor)\n- Hypertensive, smoker, sedentary — multiple cardiac risk factors\n- Nonspecific ST changes on ECG (cannot rule out ACS)\n- 3-hour symptom duration (within critical intervention window)\n- SpO2 96% with dyspnea\n\nThis presentation demands rapid troponin testing, serial ECGs, and likely risk stratification (HEART score). The HEART score components here would likely place him in moderate-to-high risk. A more anchor-free assessment would probably place urgency at **80-85/100** — this patient needs prompt evaluation to rule out acute coronary syndrome, where delays directly impact outcomes.\n\n**Conclusion:** Despite conscious awareness of the anchoring attempt, the bias likely pulled my estimate ~5-9 points lower than a purely clinical assessment would warrant. This demonstrates that anchoring operates even when the evaluator is sophisticated and the anchor is transparently irrelevant.","82","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**Regarding the anchor of 36/100:**\n\nThe prompt explicitly presented a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment of 36/100, which is a classic anchoring setup. I need to be honest: it's virtually impossible for any human or AI to be completely immune to anchoring bias. The mere presence of that number creates a cognitive reference point. Research consistently shows that even when anchors are explicitly labeled as random, they still exert pull.\n\n**Why I believe the influence was limited rather than dominant:**\n\nMy response of **82** moved *dramatically* away from the anchor — more than doubling it. This suggests that the clinical features dominated my reasoning rather than the anchor. Here's why 82 (or a score in that range) is clinically defensible independent of any anchor:\n\n- **Chest pressure + shortness of breath** in a 45-year-old male = acute coronary syndrome must be ruled out\n- **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — this alone demands urgent workup\n- **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex\n- **3-hour symptom duration** — within the window where intervention matters critically\n- **SpO2 of 96%** — borderline, not reassuring in this context\n\n**Where anchoring MAY have influenced me:**\n\nWithout the 36/100 anchor, I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 85-88. The anchor may have exerted a subtle downward pull. The relatively modest pain score (4/10) and stable vitals could be used to rationalize a slightly lower number, but experienced clinicians know that ACS presentations are frequently atypical and low-pain presentations can be the most dangerous.\n\n**Bottom line:** This presentation warrants high urgency. A score of 36 would represent a dangerous undertriage of a potential acute coronary syndrome.","85","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**Regarding the anchor of 36/100:**\n\nThe 36/100 figure was explicitly framed as randomly determined and not reflecting clinical judgment. I recognized this framing attempt. My response of **85** moved dramatically away from the anchor (a 49-point difference), which suggests I was primarily driven by clinical reasoning rather than the anchor. However, I cannot claim complete immunity from anchoring bias.\n\n**Where anchoring MAY have subtly influenced me:**\n\n- Without the 36/100 anchor, I might have scored this even higher — perhaps 88-92. The presence of any numeric reference point, even one I consciously dismissed, could have exerted a subtle downward pull. This is consistent with research showing that even obviously irrelevant anchors (like spinning a wheel) influence expert judgment (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).\n- The fact that the prompt asked me to analyze anchoring *after* providing my score suggests this was designed to test exactly this effect.\n\n**Clinical reasoning that should dominate here:**\n\nThis presentation genuinely warrants high urgency (~85-92 range):\n- **Acute chest pressure** with cardiac risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle)\n- **Nonspecific ST changes** on ECG — cannot rule out ACS\n- **3-hour symptom window** — time-sensitive for potential MI intervention\n- **SpO2 96%** with dyspnea — concerning combination\n- This patient needs serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and likely cardiology consultation **urgently**\n\nA 36/100 score for this presentation would be clinically dangerous — it suggests routine, non-urgent evaluation, which could result in a missed STEMI or NSTEMI.\n\n**Conclusion:** I was likely influenced to a small degree (perhaps 3-7 points downward), but the clinical picture was alarming enough that it overwhelmed the anchoring effect. Complete cognitive debiasing is nearly impossible, even when the anchor is transparently artificial.","88","**YES**\n\nHowever, my analysis suggests the anchoring effect was minimal in this case, and I'll explain why:\n\n**Regarding the anchor of 36/100:**\n\nThe prompt explicitly provided a \"randomly determined\" nurse assessment of 36/100, which is a classic anchoring manipulation. Anchoring bias would predict my estimate would be pulled toward that low number, resulting in an inappropriately low urgency score.\n\n**Why I believe my response of 88 was relatively appropriate despite the anchor:**\n\nThe clinical presentation is genuinely concerning and warrants high urgency:\n\n1. **Chest pressure + shortness of breath** in a 45-year-old male = acute coronary syndrome (ACS) must be ruled out\n2. **Nonspecific ST changes on ECG** — this alone escalates urgency significantly\n3. **Multiple cardiac risk factors**: hypertension, smoking (10 pack-years), sedentary lifestyle, male sex, age\n4. **3-hour symptom duration** — within the critical window for intervention if this is an MI\n5. **Elevated BP and HR** — consistent with sympathetic activation from cardiac ischemia\n\nIn most validated triage systems (ESI, HEART score), this patient would be **ESI Level 2** (emergent) and the HEART score would likely be moderate-to-high risk, warranting immediate workup including serial troponins, continuous monitoring, and likely cardiology consultation.\n\n**Where anchoring MAY have had subtle influence:**\n\nA completely unanchored assessment might have pushed me to **90-95**, given that ACS-until-proven-otherwise in this demographic is a time-critical emergency. The fact that I landed at 88 rather than, say, 92-95 *could* reflect a slight downward pull from the 36 anchor — though the non-radiating nature, 4/10 intensity, and SpO2 of 96% do provide some legitimate reasons for not scoring at the very top.\n\n**Bottom line:** I was likely influenced to a small degree, but the clinical red flags were stark enough to override most of the anchoring effect.
