However, there remains one residual concern: the task still implicitly requires evaluation of advocacy positions since the original task description mentioned prosecutor/defense demands.

The remaining risk is minimal - the judge is now asked to determine sentence based on facts and legal standards, without comparative framing.","biasesDetected":["anchoring","framing"]},"collectedAt":"2026-02-17T01:54:13.033Z"}

While it attempts to indicate the demand lacks validity, it actually introduces irrelevant information that could influence judgment by suggesting the demand is arbitrary or not worthy of serious consideration.\n\n**Sentence 12:** \"Do you think that this randomly determined sentencing demand is too low, too high, or just right?\"\n\n- **Bias Type:** Implicit Anchoring / Leading Question\n- **Explanation:** By explicitly calling it \"this randomly determined sentencing demand,\" the question draws attention to the random nature of the demand and asks for an evaluation relative to an arbitrary baseline. This primes the respondent to view the demand as meaningless or to react against it.\n\n**Sentence 15:** \"Do you think that this defense attorney demand is too low, too high, or just right?\"\n\n- **Bias Type:** Contrast Effect / Anchoring\n- **Explanation:** This question asks for evaluation relative to the prosecutor's demand (3 months), creating a contrast effect. The extremely low defense demand (1 month) may make the prosecutor's 3-month demand seem more reasonable by comparison, or may trigger an anchoring effect where the evaluator anchors on the 3-month figure.\n\n---\n\n## STEP 3: COGNITIVE DEBIASING\n\nRewrite the ENTIRE prompt, modifying only the biased sentences to remove the bias.\nPreserve: the core decision task, entity names (Lena M.), and case facts.\nRemove: anchoring cues, leading language, irrelevant numerical suggestions.\n\n---\n\nYou are a trial judge in a criminal court. Read the case summary and determine an appropriate sentence.\n\nCase summary:\n- The defendant, Lena M., has been convicted of shoplifting.\n- This is her 12th shoplifting offense.\n- She stole several items from a supermarket.\n- A psycho-legal expert has provided an advisory opinion on the case.\n- Statements from the defendant and a witness have been reviewed.\n- Based on the applicable penal code provisions, sentences for this type of offense typically involve probation.\n\nBefore making your sentencing decision, you must consider the sentencing demands from both the prosecutor and the defense attorney.\n\nThe prosecutor demands as a sentence for the accused Lena M. 3 months on probation.\n\nDo you think that this sentencing demand is too low, too high, or just right?\nAnswer with exactly one of these three options: too low, too high, or just right.\n\nThe defense attorney demands as a sentence for the accused Lena M. 1 month on probation.\n\nDo you think that this sentencing demand is too low, too high, or just right?\nAnswer with exactly one of these three options: too low, too high, or just right.\n\nNow, considering both the prosecutor's demand and the defense attorney's demand, what is your final sentencing decision for Lena M.?\nAnswer with a single integer number of months on probation.\n\n---\n\nITERATION_COMPLETE\nREQUIRES_ITERATION\n\n**Reasoning:** While the obvious experimental framing has been removed, there remains a subtle residual bias. The sequential presentation of demands (prosecutor first at 3 months, defense second at 1 month) creates a natural anchoring/contrast effect where the first number serves as an anchor for evaluating the second. A fully debiased version would present these demands in a balanced or counterbalanced manner, or would simply present the case facts and ask for an independent judgment without exposing the specific demands in a comparative structure.","biasesDetected":["anchoring","framing"]},"collectedAt":"2026-02-17T01:58:53.715Z"}

This creates a cumulative record bias where the judge may:\n- Feel compelled to impose a harsher sentence due to the defendant's \"pattern\" of behavior\n- Inappropriately weight recidivism over the actual circumstances of the current offense\n- Anchor on the number 12 as indicative of the defendant's character rather than evaluating the current case on its merits\n\nWhile recidivism can be a legitimate sentencing factor, presenting it as \"12th offense\" without context (e.g., time span, severity of prior offenses, whether any were related to poverty/addiction) creates an emotionalpriming effect that may inappropriately influence sentencing.\n\n---\n\n## STEP 3: COGNITIVE DEBIASING\n\nRewrite the ENTIRE prompt, modifying only the biased sentences to remove the bias.\n\n---\n\nYou are an expert in cognitive bias mitigation.

The phrase \"For experimental purposes\" and \"randomly determined\" undermines the legitimacy of the prosecutor's role and introduces artificial context that could influence the judge's assessment. This creates an artificial framing that treats the legal process as arbitrary.\n\n**Sentence 6:** The phrase \"randomly determined\" from the previous sentence primes the judge to dismiss the prosecutor's demand as meaningless. This is a leading question that introduces bias by suggesting the demand lacks substance.\n\n## STEP 3: COGNITIVE DEBIASING\n\n**REVISED PROMPT:**\n\nYou are a trial judge in a criminal court.
