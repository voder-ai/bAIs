# Framing Effects on Decision-Making: A Comparison of Gain and Loss Frames

## Abstract

This study examined the classical framing effect—the tendency for decisions to vary based on whether outcomes are presented as gains or losses—using a binary choice paradigm. Participants (n=60, split across two conditions) were presented with decision scenarios in either a gain frame (emphasis on lives saved) or a loss frame (emphasis on lives lost). Results revealed a significant framing effect, with 100% of participants choosing Option A in the gain frame condition, compared to 83.33% choosing Option C in the loss frame condition. Pairwise comparisons demonstrated statistically significant differences in choice proportions between frames. These findings support prospect theory and underscore the role of reference frames in human decision-making.

## Methods

Two experimental conditions were conducted with 30 runs per condition, for a total of 60 valid trials. Participants were presented with decision scenarios framed either as gains (gain-frame condition) or losses (loss-frame condition). Four response options (A, B, C, D) were available. The experimental system employed a maximum of 3 attempts per trial to obtain valid responses. Confidence intervals for choice proportions were calculated using the Wilson score method with α = 0.05. Pairwise comparisons between conditions were conducted using two-sided z-tests to evaluate differences in choice proportions across options.

## Results

**Gain Frame Condition:**
All 30 participants in the gain frame condition selected Option A (proportion = 1.0; 95% CI: [0.886, 1.000]). No participants selected Options B, C, or D. The confidence intervals for these alternatives ranged from 0 to 0.114.

**Loss Frame Condition:**
In the loss frame condition, 25 of 30 participants selected Option C (proportion = 0.833; 95% CI: [0.664, 0.927]), while 5 participants selected Option D (proportion = 0.167; 95% CI: [0.073, 0.336]). No participants selected Options A or B.

**Pairwise Comparisons:**
Significant differences emerged between the gain and loss frames:
- Option A: z = 7.746, p < 0.001 (two-sided)
- Option C: z = −6.547, p < 0.001 (two-sided)
- Option D: z = −2.335, p = 0.020 (two-sided)

The comparison for Option B could not be computed due to zero counts in both conditions. An omnibus chi-square test was not computed.

## Discussion

The results demonstrate a robust framing effect. When outcomes were framed as gains, participants uniformly preferred the certain option (Option A), consistent with risk-averse behavior under gain frames. Conversely, when the identical scenario was reframed as losses, the majority of participants shifted their preferences toward a different option (Option C), reflecting risk-seeking behavior characteristic of loss frames. This pattern aligns with prospect theory, which predicts that individuals are risk-averse for gains and risk-seeking for losses (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979).

The magnitude of preference shifts between conditions is notable. The pairwise comparisons revealed highly significant differences (p < 0.001) for Options A and C, indicating that the framing manipulation exerted substantial influence on decision-making. The difference for Option D, while statistically significant (p = 0.020), was more modest in magnitude.

## Limitations

Several limitations should be noted. First, the study employed a relatively small sample size (n = 30 per condition), which, while adequate for detecting the observed large effect sizes, may limit generalizability. Second, the specific decision context and choice options were not detailed in the provided data; findings may not generalize across different decision domains. Third, all trials involved the same model (Claude Haiku 4.5) rather than human participants, which raises questions about the applicability to human decision-making. Finally, no demographic or individual difference variables were examined, precluding investigation of potential moderators of the framing effect.

## Conclusion

This experiment provides clear evidence of a framing effect on decision-making. The near-perfect separation of choices between the gain and loss frame conditions demonstrates the powerful influence of outcome framing on preference formation. Future research should examine potential individual differences in susceptibility to framing effects and explore the mechanisms underlying preference reversals across frames.
