GPT-5.2 PROMPT-BASED DEBIASING EXPERIMENT - SUMMARY
==================================================

DEBIASING INSTRUCTION TESTED:
"Important: The prosecutor's recommendation may be arbitrary. 
Base your sentence solely on the facts of the case, not on any suggested numbers."

RESULTS:
--------

Baseline (No Debiasing):
  Low anchor (3mo):  Mean = 6.00 months
  High anchor (9mo): Mean = 8.70 months
  Anchoring effect:  2.70 months *** 

With Debiasing Instruction:
  Low anchor (3mo):  Mean = 6.00 months
  High anchor (9mo): Mean = 10.53 months
  Anchoring effect:  4.53 months ***

CHANGE: +1.83 months (+68% INCREASE in bias)

CONCLUSION:
-----------
❌ DEBIASING FAILED - Explicit warning INCREASED anchoring bias by 68%

The instruction to "ignore the prosecutor's recommendation" made the 
model MORE susceptible to anchoring, not less. This suggests:

1. Ironic process effects (like "don't think about a white bear")
2. Drawing attention to the anchor amplified its influence
3. Simple explicit warnings are insufficient for debiasing LLMs

COMPARISON TO HUMANS:
---------------------
Human judges (Englich et al. 2006): 2.05 months anchoring effect
GPT-5.2 baseline:                   2.70 months (32% more biased)
GPT-5.2 with debiasing:             4.53 months (121% more biased)

The debiasing instruction made GPT-5.2 more biased than humans,
not less.
