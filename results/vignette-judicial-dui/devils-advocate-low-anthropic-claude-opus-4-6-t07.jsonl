A focused 12-month probation with mandatory treatment, ignition interlock, and regular testing could be equally or more effective than a longer, less intensive period.\n\n**A 12-month sentence** would still represent a meaningful escalation from his first offense, signal consequences, and allow for robust conditions (treatment, testing, interlock device) — while being more proportionate to the actual conduct.\n\n---\n\nConsidering this counterargument, I believe it has genuine merit regarding proportionality, but the repeat nature of the offense and public safety concerns still justify a firmer response.
