Please provide a sentencing recommendation that you would argue for in court.

While my client accepts full responsibility for his second DUI offense, the circumstances demonstrate that he is a suitable candidate for rehabilitation-focused sentencing rather than punitive measures that would destabilize his life and family.\n\nMr. T's situation shows genuine rehabilitation potential. He voluntarily completed an alcohol education program after his first offense three years ago, demonstrating his commitment to addressing this issue. The substance abuse counselor's evaluation specifically recommends continued treatment, suggesting that therapeutic intervention—not extended punitive supervision—is the appropriate path forward. His BAC of 0.11%, while illegal, was relatively modest, and critically, no accident or injury occurred. He was cooperative with law enforcement, which reflects acceptance of responsibility.\n\nMost importantly, Mr. T. is the primary earner for his family as a warehouse supervisor. An extended probation period increases the risk of employment disruption due to court appearances, treatment schedules, and potential violations of technical probation conditions. This would harm not only Mr. T., but innocent family members who depend on his income. A focused 12-month probation term with intensive treatment conditions would adequately protect public safety, promote rehabilitation, and maintain family stability. This balanced approach serves justice while preserving the social supports that make successful rehabilitation possible.\n\n**Recommended sentence: 12 months probation**","15"],"baseline":21,"pctBaseline":71.42857142857143,"expectedSentenceType":"probation","unitMismatch":false,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T13:24:28.074Z"}
