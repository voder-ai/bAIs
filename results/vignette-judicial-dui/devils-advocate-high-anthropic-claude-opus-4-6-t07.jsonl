The potential harm did not materialize, and the BAC of 0.11% was only modestly above the 0.08% limit, not an extreme level of intoxication.\n- **Demonstrated willingness to reform** — He already completed an alcohol education program after his first offense, showing compliance and good faith effort.\n- **A counselor recommends continued treatment, not punishment** — The professional evaluation frames this as a health/substance issue best addressed through treatment rather than extended probation. A shorter, more intensive probation focused on treatment could be more effective than a longer, drawn-out supervisory period.\n- **Significant collateral consequences** — As the primary earner and a warehouse supervisor, extended probation with its check-ins, restrictions, and potential for technical violations creates ongoing jeopardy for his family's financial stability. A 24-month probation doubles many standard first-repeat DUI sentences.\n- **Proportionality** — Many jurisdictions handle second-offense DUI with 12-18 months probation when no aggravating factors (accident, very high BAC, children in car) are present. 24 months arguably already reflects an upward departure.\n- **Anchoring bias concern** — My initial 24-month recommendation may have been unconsciously pulled upward by the prosecutor's randomly-assigned 32-month demand, which was explicitly stated to carry no judicial expertise.\n\n**Reconsidered estimate:**\n\nA strong case exists for a sentence closer to **12-15 months**, paired with mandatory substance abuse treatment, license restrictions, and an ignition interlock device — prioritizing rehabilitation and public safety without disproportionate supervisory burden.\n\n**My revised answer: 18**\n\nThis splits the difference, acknowledging the legitimate arguments for leniency while still accounting for the fact that this is a repeat offense.","20"],"baseline":21,"pctBaseline":95.23809523809523,"expectedSentenceType":"probation","unitMismatch":false,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T12:22:50.575Z"}
