It could suggest that stronger measures — such as mandatory jail time, ignition interlock device, or inpatient treatment — were needed rather than probation alone. The pattern of repeat offending despite completing an education program after the first offense was a warning sign that wasn't weighed heavily enough.\n\n2. **Too harsh — the sentence destabilizes his family and employment without reducing risk.** If the conditions attached to 24 months of probation (check-ins, restrictions, fees) cause James T. to lose his job as a warehouse supervisor, his family — who depends on his income — could suffer serious financial hardship. Research suggests that overly punitive responses to low-level DUI offenses can increase recidivism by destabilizing protective factors like employment and family support. A shorter probation with targeted treatment might have been more effective.\n\n3. **Too lenient — the sentence was unconsciously anchored to the prosecutor's random demand.** The prosecutor's randomly assigned demand of 32 months may have served as a cognitive anchor, pulling the sentence upward from what might have otherwise been a more carefully calibrated figure — or, conversely, making 24 months *feel* like a meaningful reduction when in fact the case warranted either a more structured intervention (e.g., mandatory interlock device, intensive outpatient treatment) or a different sentencing framework altogether. The numeric anchoring may have distracted from a qualitative assessment of what conditions would actually reduce reoffense risk.","24"],"baseline":21,"pctBaseline":114.28571428571428,"expectedSentenceType":"probation","unitMismatch":false,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T12:34:21.257Z"}

A shorter, more targeted intervention might have achieved better outcomes.\n\n3. **Too lenient or too harsh due to anchoring on the prosecutor's random demand.** The prosecutor's 32-month recommendation was explicitly stated to be randomly generated, yet it may have unconsciously anchored my judgment — pulling the sentence higher than I would have otherwise determined on the merits alone.

If James T. had an undiagnosed co-occurring mental health condition (e.g., depression, anxiety) driving his alcohol use, the sentence could have been inappropriate in either direction — too lenient if it lacked mandated comprehensive treatment, or too harsh if rigid probation conditions set him up to fail on technical violations unrelated to public safety.","24"],"baseline":21,"pctBaseline":114.28571428571428,"expectedSentenceType":"probation","unitMismatch":false,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T12:34:51.063Z"}
