The prior completion of an alcohol education program, paired with a new recommendation for continued treatment, suggests some ongoing risk but also a clear path for rehabilitation that probation can support. Employment and being the primary earner likely pulled my judgment toward a non-custodial, supervision-focused sentence to reduce collateral harm to dependents.\n\nPotential biases: I may have given extra mitigating weight to stable employment/family impact (a common source of leniency that can inadvertently favor defendants with more conventional social supports). I may also have anchored near the prosecutor’s 11-month request and rounded up, which is a form of anchoring bias.
