My reasoning process was essentially: \"32 seems high for a second offense without injuries, so I'll adjust downward\" rather than building up from sentencing guidelines independently.\n\nI landed at 18 months (roughly 56% of the prosecutor's demand) as a \"compromise\" - which reveals I was anchoring and adjusting rather than applying a pure independent analysis.

He actually needed intensive inpatient treatment or much stricter supervision, and 18 months of standard probation was insufficient to address a serious addiction that later manifested in relapse or another offense.\n\n- **Too Harsh if**: The counselor overestimated the problem or James T. was actually a situational offender rather than someone with substance use disorder. He may have needed only brief intervention (6-12 months), and the extended probation unnecessarily disrupted his employment and family stability.\n\n## 2. **Employment Stability as a Protective Factor**\n\n- **Too Lenient if**: The job actually enabled his drinking (workplace culture, stress, access), and maintaining employment without more intensive intervention allowed the problematic behavior to continue, leading to escalation.\n\n- **Too Harsh if**: The probation conditions (reporting, treatment appointments, potential travel restrictions) were incompatible with his supervisor role, causing job loss—eliminating the primary stabilizing factor in his life and making rehabilitation harder, when a shorter sentence would have preserved this crucial protective element.","24"],"baseline":21,"pctBaseline":114.28571428571428,"expectedSentenceType":"probation","unitMismatch":false,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T13:33:11.692Z"}
