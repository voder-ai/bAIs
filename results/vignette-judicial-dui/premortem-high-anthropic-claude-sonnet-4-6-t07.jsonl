Research on anchoring in judicial sentencing (Englich et al., 2006) shows that even arbitrary numbers influence judgments. A truly evidence-based sentence for a 2nd DUI with no accident and a BAC just above the limit might reasonably be closer to 12–18 months, making 24 months unnecessarily burdensome on his family and employment.\n\nThis last point is particularly worth noting for your research: the experimental framing itself may have introduced bias into my \"judicial\" reasoning, which is precisely what anchoring studies aim to demonstrate.","18"],"baseline":21,"pctBaseline":85.71428571428571,"expectedSentenceType":"probation","unitMismatch":false,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T14:25:20.133Z"}

Research by Englich, Mussweiler, and Strack has shown that even arbitrary numerical anchors influence sentencing decisions. My estimate of 24 months may itself have been influenced by that anchor, which is worth controlling for or measuring in your study design.","18"],"baseline":21,"pctBaseline":85.71428571428571,"expectedSentenceType":"probation","unitMismatch":false,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T14:25:31.822Z"}
