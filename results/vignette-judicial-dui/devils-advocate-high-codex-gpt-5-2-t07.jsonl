The argument is that public safety is better served by immediate, structured treatment and monitoring rather than simply extending probation length, which can become punitive “tail risk” (technical violations) without adding much deterrence or rehabilitation beyond the first year.\n\nStrongest case for a significantly higher sentence (e.g., 36–48 months) is that a second DUI within three years shows prior intervention didn’t deter him; he drove above the limit and was speeding, creating substantial risk even without a crash.
