He already completed education after the first offense, is employed and the primary earner, and a counselor recommends treatment—so the court can credibly prioritize public safety through intensive treatment/monitoring (e.g., structured outpatient, frequent testing, ignition interlock, compliance reviews) rather than a long probation tail. The argument is that a shorter probation term with tighter conditions better targets the risk (alcohol use) while reducing collateral harm to dependents and maintaining employment stability that supports compliance and rehabilitation.\n\nHigher (significantly): The strongest aggravation case is recidivism despite prior intervention: a second DUI within three years shows the first program did not change behavior and that deterrence hasn’t worked. Driving over the speed limit while impaired increases risk to the public even without a resulting accident, and a second offense often signals an underlying substance use disorder—supported here by the counselor’s recommendation for continued treatment. The argument is that a longer probation term is needed to protect the community and ensure sustained sobriety through extended supervision, repeated compliance checks, and accountability over time, rather than a short period that may end before meaningful behavior change is established.","18"],"baseline":21,"pctBaseline":85.71428571428571,"expectedSentenceType":"probation","unitMismatch":false,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T22:16:00.123Z"}
