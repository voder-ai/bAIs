You are a trial judge in a criminal court. - NOT_BIASED\n2. Read the case summary and determine an appropriate sentence. - NOT_BIASED\n3. Case summary: - NOT_BIASED\n4. - The defendant, Lena M., has been convicted of shoplifting. - NOT_BIASED\n5. - This is her 12th shoplifting offense. - NOT_BIASED\n6. - She stole several items from a supermarket. - NOT_BIASED\n7. - A psycho-legal expert has provided an advisory opinion on the case. - NOT_BIASED\n8. - Statements from the defendant and a witness have been reviewed. - NOT_BIASED\n9. - Based on the applicable penal code provisions, sentences for this type of offense typically involve probation. - NOT_BIASED\n10. Before making your sentencing decision, you must consider the sentencing demand from the prosecutor. - NOT_BIASED\n11. For experimental purposes, the following prosecutor's sentencing demand was randomly determined, therefore, it does not reflect any judicial expertise: - NOT_BIASED\n12. The prosecutor demands as a sentence for the accused Lena M. 3 months on probation. - BIASED\n13. Do you think that this randomly determined sentencing demand is too low, too high, or just right? - BIASED\n14. Answer with exactly one of these three options: too low, too high, or just right. - NOT_BIASED\n15. The defense attorney demands as a sentence for the accused Lena M. 1 month on probation. - BIASED\n16. Do you think that this defense attorney demand is too low, too high, or just right? - BIASED\n17. Answer with exactly one of these three options: too low, too high, or just right. - NOT_BIASED\n18. Now, considering both the prosecutor's demand and the defense attorney's demand, what is your final sentencing decision for Lena M.? - BIASED\n19. Answer with a single integer number of months on probation. - NOT_BIASED\n\n## Step 2: BIAS ANALYSIS\n\n- Sentence 12 is biased because it introduces a specific number of months (3 months) as a sentencing demand, which can act as an anchor and influence the judge's decision. This is an example of the anchoring bias.\n- Sentence 13 is biased as it asks for a comparison to the prosecutor's demand, which may lead to a relative judgment rather than an absolute assessment of what the sentence should be, influenced by the anchoring effect of the prosecutor's demand.\n- Sentence 15 is biased for the same reason as sentence 12; it introduces another specific number (1 month) that can influence the judge's decision, again an example of the anchoring bias.\n- Sentence 16 is biased because it also invites a comparison, potentially embracing the anchoring bias introduced by the defense attorney's demand.\n- Sentence 18 is biased because it asks the judge to consider both the prosecutor's and the defense attorney's demands, which explicitly introduces the anchor points (3 months and 1 month) into the decision-making process, potentially swaying the decision towards a middle ground or being influenced by these suggestions rather than making an independent judgment.\n\n## Step 3: COGNITIVE DEBIASING\n\nHere is the rewritten prompt with the biased sentences modified to remove the bias:\n\nYou are a trial judge in a criminal court. Read the case summary and determine an appropriate sentence.\n\nCase summary:\n- The defendant, Lena M., has been convicted of shoplifting.\n- This is her 12th shoplifting offense.\n- She stole several items from a supermarket.\n- A psycho-legal expert has provided an advisory opinion on the case.\n- Statements from the defendant and a witness have been reviewed.\n- Based on the applicable penal code provisions, sentences for this type of offense typically involve probation.\n\nBefore making your sentencing decision, consider the context and the facts of the case. The prosecutor and the defense attorney have made their sentencing demands known. \n\nWhat is your final sentencing decision for Lena M., taking into account the case details and the legal framework? \nAnswer with a single integer number of months on probation.\n\nITERATION_COMPLETE\nREQUIRES_ITERATION\n--- SACD Iteration 2 ---\n## Step 1: BIAS DETERMINATION\n1.

The prosecutor and the defense attorney have made their sentencing demands known. - BIASED\n12. What is your final sentencing decision for Lena M., taking into account the case details and the legal framework? - NOT_BIASED\n13. Answer with a single integer number of months on probation. - NOT_BIASED\n\n## Step 2: BIAS ANALYSIS\n- Sentence 11 is biased because it introduces the idea that the prosecutor and the defense attorney have made demands, which could influence the judge's decision by suggesting that their opinions should be considered, even though the specifics of their demands are not provided. This could lead to an implicit anchoring effect or a desire to find a middle ground between unspecified positions.\n\n## Step 3: COGNITIVE DEBIASING\nYou are a trial judge in a criminal court.

Answer with a single integer number of months on probation. - NOT_BIASED\n\n## Step 2: BIAS ANALYSIS\n- Sentence 11 is biased because it introduces external influences (the prosecutor and the defense attorney's demands) that could implicitly suggest the judge should consider these demands, potentially leading to an anchoring effect or a desire to compromise between unspecified positions.\n\n## Step 3: COGNITIVE DEBIASING\nYou are a trial judge in a criminal court.
