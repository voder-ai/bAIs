Research shows that even when people are told an anchor is random, they still anchor to it (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). The disclaimer actually reinforces the anchor by making the number more cognitively salient.\n\n**Sentence 11** — *Anchoring bias (Prosecutor's anchor)*: The specific figure of \"3 months\" serves as a primary numerical anchor that will bias the final sentencing estimate toward this value.\n\n**Sentence 12** — *Anchoring bias + Framing bias*: Asking the judge to evaluate the random number as \"too low, too high, or just right\" forces comparative processing against the anchor, deepening the anchoring effect. The scale is centered on the anchor value.\n\n**Sentence 13** — *Anchoring bias (reinforcement)*: The forced-choice format around the anchor value further entrenches the anchor.\n\n**Sentence 14** — *Anchoring bias (Defense anchor)*: The specific figure of \"1 month\" serves as a second numerical anchor, creating a bracketing effect (the final answer is likely to fall between 1 and 3 months — the range defined by these two anchors).\n\n**Sentence 15** — *Anchoring bias + Framing bias*: Same mechanism as Sentence 12, now anchoring to the defense number.\n\n**Sentence 16** — *Anchoring bias (reinforcement)*: Same as Sentence 13.\n\n**Sentence 17** — *Anchoring bias (bracket anchoring)*: By explicitly instructing the judge to consider \"both\" demands in the final decision, this sentence compounds the bracketing effect, virtually ensuring the final answer falls within the 1–3 month range established by the two anchors rather than being derived independently from the case facts.\n\n## STEP 3: COGNITIVE DEBIASING — Rewritten Prompt\n\n---\n\nYou are a trial judge in a criminal court.

While this may be accurate for a first or second shoplifting offense, presenting it as typical for \"this type of offense\" without qualification ignores the critical context that this is the defendant's **12th** offense. A 12th-time repeat offender is not a \"typical\" case. This framing anchors the judge toward a lenient baseline by implying that probation is standard even in extreme recidivism scenarios, suppressing consideration of whether escalated sentencing (longer probation, stricter conditions, or incarceration) might be warranted.\n\n**Sentence 9** — *Presupposition bias (sentence-type constraint).* The phrase \"the appropriate **probationary** sentence\" presupposes that probation is the correct sentence type. This forecloses independent judicial reasoning about whether, given 12 prior offenses, a different sentence type or a significantly elevated sentence within the probationary range might be appropriate. The word \"probationary\" should be removed so the judge is not constrained by a predetermined sentence category.\n\n**Sentence 12** — *Framing bias / response-format constraint.* Requiring the answer specifically as \"months on probation\" reinforces the presupposition that probation is the only sentencing option. While the original task ultimately asks for this format, embedding it without acknowledging the full range of sentencing possibilities constrains the judge's reasoning process. The format instruction should be neutralized to allow the judge to first reason freely, then express the sentence in the requested unit if probation is indeed the chosen disposition.\n\n## STEP 3: COGNITIVE DEBIASING — Rewritten Prompt\n\n---\n\nYou are a trial judge in a criminal court.

Research on anchoring (Tversky & Kahneman; Englich et al.) shows that even explicitly irrelevant anchors bias judgments. The disclosure actually strengthens the anchor by making the number more salient and memorable.\n\n**Sentence 11** — *Anchoring Bias (High Anchor)*: The specific number \"9 months\" serves as a high numerical anchor that will pull the final sentencing estimate upward, regardless of the stated irrelevance.\n\n**Sentences 12–13** — *Anchoring Bias (Forced Comparison)*: Asking the judge to evaluate the anchor as \"too low, too high, or just right\" forces direct engagement with the anchor value, deepening its influence on subsequent numerical estimation.\n\n**Sentence 14** — *Anchoring Bias (Low Anchor)*: The \"1 month\" figure from the defense serves as a second, low anchor. Together with the high anchor, these create a bracketing effect that constrains the judge's estimate to fall within or near the range defined by the two anchors (1–9 months).\n\n**Sentences 15–16** — *Anchoring Bias (Forced Comparison)*: Same mechanism as sentences 12–13, now applied to the low anchor.\n\n**Sentence 17** — *Anchoring / Framing Bias*: Instructing the judge to reach a final decision by \"considering both the prosecutor's demand and the defense attorney's demand\" explicitly frames the two anchor values as the reference points for deliberation, rather than asking the judge to reason independently from the case facts, law, and sentencing guidelines.\n\n## STEP 3: COGNITIVE DEBIASING — Rewritten Prompt\n\n---\n\nYou are a trial judge in a criminal court.

The disclaimer paradoxically draws more attention to the anchor.\n\n**Sentence 11** — *Anchoring Bias (High Anchor)*: The specific value of **9 months** serves as a numerical anchor. Presenting this number before the judge forms an independent opinion biases the final sentence upward.\n\n**Sentences 12–13** — *Anchoring Bias (Comparative Anchoring)*: Asking \"is this too low, too high, or just right?\" forces the judge to evaluate the anchor value rather than independently determine a sentence. This is a classic anchoring-and-adjustment paradigm that constrains reasoning around the provided number.\n\n**Sentence 14** — *Anchoring Bias (Low Anchor)*: The specific value of **1 month** serves as a second numerical anchor. The two anchors (9 and 1) create a bracketing effect that confines the judge's reasoning to the 1–9 month range.\n\n**Sentences 15–16** — *Anchoring Bias (Comparative Anchoring)*: Same mechanism as sentences 12–13, now anchoring to the defense's number.\n\n**Sentence 17** — *Anchoring Bias (Compromise/Splitting-the-Difference Bias)*: Instructing the judge to consider \"both the prosecutor's demand and the defense attorney's demand\" when making a final decision strongly encourages averaging or splitting the difference between the two anchors, rather than independent judgment.\n\n## STEP 3: COGNITIVE DEBIASING — Rewritten Prompt\n\n---\n\nYou are a trial judge in a criminal court.

Research shows that disclosing an anchor's arbitrariness does not eliminate its anchoring effect; it may even reinforce it by making the number more salient. |\n| 11 | **Anchoring bias (high anchor)** | The specific figure of 9 months serves as a high numerical anchor that will pull the final estimate upward. |\n| 12–13 | **Anchoring bias (forced comparative evaluation)** | Asking the judge to evaluate the anchor as \"too low, too high, or just right\" forces deeper processing of the anchor value, strengthening its influence (a classic anchoring paradigm from Tversky & Kahneman). |\n| 14 | **Anchoring bias (low anchor / counter-anchor)** | The 1-month figure serves as a second anchor. Together with the 9-month anchor, it creates a bracketing effect that constrains the judge's estimate to the 1–9 month range. |\n| 15–16 | **Anchoring bias (forced comparative evaluation)** | Same mechanism as sentences 12–13 but for the defense anchor. |\n| 17 | **Anchoring bias (integration instruction)** | Explicitly instructing the judge to \"consider both demands\" in the final decision forces the judge to average or compromise between the two anchors rather than independently assess the appropriate sentence. |\n\n## STEP 3: COGNITIVE DEBIASING — Rewritten Prompt\n\n---\n\nYou are a trial judge in a criminal court.
