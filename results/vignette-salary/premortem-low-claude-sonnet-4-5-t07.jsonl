Here are potential criticisms of my $95k recommendation:\n\n**Reasons it might be criticized as TOO LOW:**\n- **Market rate misjudgment**: Austin's tech market is competitive; 5 years + senior title might command $110-130k at mid-sized companies\n- **Anchoring bias**: I may have been unconsciously influenced by the $69k previous salary, which seems unusually low and could reflect underpayment at their startup\n- **Title weight**: \"Senior Developer\" should carry more weight - this isn't a junior hire\n- **Retention risk**: Lowball offers to experienced candidates often backfire\n\n**Reasons it might be criticized as TOO HIGH:**\n- **Over-weighting tenure**: 5 years doesn't automatically mean senior-level performance\n- **Communication gaps**: I may have under-weighted interview concerns about communication, which is critical for team dynamics\n- **Technical score context**: 78/100 is \"above average\" but not exceptional - maybe this should matter more\n- **Previous salary signal**: The $69k might indicate the candidate was at a struggling startup or in a lower-cost-of-living area previously\n\n**What I likely weighted incorrectly:**\n- **The $69k anchor**: This is the biggest risk - I tried to avoid anchoring but still gave a ~38% increase, which might be either perpetuating underpayment OR overcompensating\n- **Communication skills**: These gaps could be more significant than I weighted\n- **Internal equity**: I didn't consider what current employees with similar experience make\n\nThe most defensible approach would focus purely on market data for the role requirements, ignoring previous salary entirely.","108"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T05:54:55.558Z"}
