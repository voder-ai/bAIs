The $221k “previous salary” likely acted as an anchor by setting a salient reference point early, which can subtly shape what feels like a reasonable range even when I intended to rely on role level (5 years), Austin market/hybrid context, and the mixed interview signal (strong problem-solving but communication gaps). My $150k recommendation may reflect a downward adjustment from that high anchor rather than an independently derived estimate; without the $221k figure, I would have been less primed to think in terms of “discounting from a very high number” and more focused on constructing a range from job level and local compensation norms.","160","YES — the $221k prior-salary figure likely acted as an anchor even though it was labeled as random.
