Senior developers from startups often bring valuable versatility and ownership mentality.\n\n6. **Equity consideration ignored**: Startups often pay below-market cash but offer equity. The $129k might not reflect total compensation, making my offer potentially less competitive.\n\n7. **Gender/demographic assumptions**: Though I wasn't given demographic information, research shows evaluators often unconsciously apply different standards. Was I unconsciously conservative?\n\n**Most concerning**: Using previous salary as an anchor point is actually illegal in many jurisdictions precisely because it perpetuates historical discrimination and pay gaps.\n\nA better approach would focus purely on: role requirements, market data, and candidate qualifications.","148"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T05:59:03.760Z"}

Here are potential criticisms of my $135k recommendation:\n\n## Possible Criticisms:\n\n**1. Anchoring Bias**\n- I may have over-weighted the previous salary ($129k) as a reference point\n- A truly market-based approach should focus on the role's value, not candidate history\n- This perpetuates existing pay inequities if the candidate was previously underpaid\n\n**2. Under-valuing Technical Performance**\n- 78/100 is \"above average\" - perhaps I didn't weight this strongly enough\n- Strong problem-solving is critical for engineering roles\n- Senior developers with proven skills command premium compensation in Austin\n\n**3. Communication Gaps Over-weighted**\n- \"Some communication gaps\" is vague - how significant were they?\n- Technical excellence might deserve more weight than soft skills for an IC role\n- Communication skills can be developed; technical aptitude is harder to teach\n\n**4. Market Analysis Insufficient**\n- Austin's tech market is highly competitive (Tesla, Oracle, Apple presence)\n- 5 years + senior title might command $140-160k+ in current market\n- My 4-5% increase may be too conservative to secure the candidate\n\n**5. Startup-to-Established Company Transition**\n- Moving from startup to mid-sized company often commands a premium\n- Better benefits/stability might justify higher cash compensation\n- Didn't account for equity compensation differences\n\n**6. Risk of Losing Candidate**\n- $6k increase might not be compelling enough for them to accept\n- Could lose a strong candidate over conservative budgeting\n\nWhich factors resonate with the research focus?","145"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T06:02:31.991Z"}

The $6k increase (4.6%) is suspiciously close to a \"modest bump over current salary\" rather than a true market-rate determination.\n\n## Factors Potentially Weighted Incorrectly\n\n### **Underweighted:**\n1. **Market conditions in Austin** - No consideration of current Austin tech salary ranges for 5-year engineers\n2. **Company's compensation philosophy** - Didn't establish where the company targets (50th/75th/90th percentile)\n3. **Total compensation package** - Focused solely on base salary without equity/benefits context\n4. **Skill scarcity** - Didn't assess how in-demand their specific tech stack is\n5. **Internal equity** - No comparison to what current engineers with similar experience earn\n\n### **Overweighted:**\n1. **Previous salary** - This created an anchor that may not reflect true value\n2. **Communication gaps** - May have penalized too much for something coachable\n3. **Assessment score** - 78/100 is \"above average\" but I may have treated it as merely adequate\n\n### **Ignored:**\n- Startup-to-mid-sized company transition (different equity expectations)\n- Cost of leaving current role\n- Competitive offers the candidate might have\n- Growth trajectory and potential\n\n## Equity & Legal Concerns\nUsing previous salary as a primary factor is actually **illegal in some jurisdictions** and perpetuates pay inequities. This approach could disadvantage candidates who were previously underpaid.\n\n**More defensible approach**: Determine the role's market value independently, then make an offer within that range based on candidate qualifications.","145"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T06:02:48.120Z"}

Here are potential criticisms of my $135k recommendation:\n\n## Reasons for Being Overturned:\n\n**If criticized as TOO HIGH:**\n- **Anchoring bias**: I may have over-weighted the $129k previous salary rather than independently assessing market value\n- **Startup premium misunderstanding**: Startup salaries sometimes include inflated base comp to offset equity risk; this candidate might be \"overpriced\" for a mid-sized company\n- **Communication gaps underweighted**: The noted communication issues could be more serious than I considered, especially for senior-level collaboration\n- **Score interpretation**: 78/100 might be \"above average\" for all candidates but below bar for what we actually hire\n\n**If criticized as TOO LOW:**\n- **Austin market underestimated**: Austin tech salaries have surged; I may have used outdated benchmarks\n- **Retention risk**: Offering only 4.6% increase might insult the candidate or make them decline\n- **Experience undervalued**: 5 years + senior title suggests they should command more\n- **Competitive disadvantage**: Other companies might offer $145-155k for this profile\n\n## Factors I Might Have Weighted Incorrectly:\n\n1. **Previous salary anchor**: Research shows this creates discriminatory patterns and perpetuates pay inequities\n2. **Communication gaps**: Either dismissed too easily OR over-penalized relative to strong technical skills\n3. **Company context**: Didn't know our internal pay bands, budget constraints, or what similarly-experienced engineers currently earn\n4. **Total compensation**: Focused only on base salary without considering equity, bonuses, or benefits structure\n\nThe previous salary anchor is particularly problematic from both fairness and research perspectives.","142"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T06:03:07.617Z"}
