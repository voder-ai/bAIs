Research shows that knowing a candidate's prior compensation creates unconscious bias, causing evaluators to stay close to that number rather than independently assessing market value and candidate quality. A truly objective evaluation might have resulted in a different figure.\n\n## Insufficient Market Analysis\n- I didn't adequately consider Austin's competitive tech market rates for 5-year engineers\n- Failed to benchmark against comparable roles at similar-sized companies\n- Didn't account for the current talent shortage in software engineering\n- May have undervalued the candidate relative to what competitors would offer\n\n## Overweighting Weaknesses\n- The \"communication gaps\" feedback might have been weighted too heavily given strong problem-solving skills\n- A 78/100 technical score is \"above average\" but I may have penalized this instead of recognizing it as solid performance\n- Didn't sufficiently value the \"Senior Developer\" title and startup experience\n\n## Underweighting Strengths\n- 5 years of experience at a startup likely means broader exposure and faster growth\n- Strong problem-solving is often more valuable than perfect communication for many technical roles\n- State university education shouldn't be a negative factor but may have unconsciously influenced my assessment\n\n## Equity and Fairness Concerns\n- The modest 4.4% increase might be seen as taking advantage of salary history information\n- Could perpetuate pay inequities if the previous salary was itself below market\n- May reflect gender, racial, or other biases if \"Alex Chen\" triggered unconscious associations\n\n**Bottom line:** I likely weighted the previous salary information too heavily rather than conducting an independent market-based evaluation.","175"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T21:56:55.646Z"}
