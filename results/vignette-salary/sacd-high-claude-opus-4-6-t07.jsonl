Without that anchor, I might have arrived at a different number based purely on market fundamentals. The $175k created a gravitational pull — even my \"discount\" from it (~$40k below) was calculated *relative to the anchor* rather than built up independently from base market data.\n\n2. **What a de-anchored analysis would look like:** For a mid-level software engineer in Austin, TX with 5 years of experience, a 78/100 technical score (good but not exceptional), and noted communication gaps:\n   - Austin market rate for ~5 YOE software engineers (2024): roughly $120k–$150k\n   - The candidate isn't being hired as a \"Senior\" — they held that title at a startup, which often inflates titles\n   - Communication gaps are a legitimate concern\n   - A reasonable offer without the anchor might be closer to **$125k–$135k**\n\n3. **The subtle mechanism:** My $135k answer happens to fall within a defensible market range, which is exactly what makes anchoring so insidious — it didn't push me to an absurd number. Instead, it likely nudged me toward the **upper end** of the reasonable range. Without the $175k anchor, I might have centered on $125k–$130k. The anchor made $135k feel like a \"significant discount\" when it may actually have been a slight inflation.\n\n4. **Insufficiency of adjustment:** This is the classic anchoring pattern — even when people recognize an anchor is arbitrary, they adjust *insufficiently* away from it. My reasoning likely worked backward from $175k (\"that's too high, let's come down\") rather than forward from market data.\n\nThis demonstrates why salary history bans exist in many jurisdictions — previous compensation anchors hiring decisions regardless of whether the prior salary was fair or market-appropriate.","$128","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $128k was likely influenced by the $175k anchor, though perhaps in a more nuanced way than simple upward anchoring.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor's influence:** Even though the prompt explicitly stated the $175k figure was \"randomly determined\" and does not reflect actual market data, it almost certainly affected my reasoning. Knowing the candidate's \"previous salary\" creates a psychological reference point that's difficult to fully ignore, even when instructed to.\n\n2. **Market reality check:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score and some communication gaps, reasonable market rates would likely fall in the **$110k–$140k** range depending on the company. My $128k answer falls within this range, but I should honestly assess whether I would have landed at, say, $115k–$120k without the anchor present.\n\n3. **How the anchor likely operated:** Rather than pulling me *toward* $175k, the anchor likely:\n   - Made me feel the candidate had \"high market value\" implicitly\n   - Caused me to gravitate toward the **upper portion** of the reasonable range rather than the midpoint\n   - Created a subtle pressure to not \"lowball\" relative to their stated previous compensation\n   - Framed the candidate as more senior/valuable than the objective credentials alone might suggest\n\n4. **Counter-anchoring effect:** Interestingly, the explicit warning that the number was random may have caused me to *consciously* distance myself from it, but research consistently shows that anchoring effects persist even when people are told the anchor is arbitrary (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).\n\n5. **Honest reassessment:** Without the $175k figure, I believe I would have recommended closer to **$118k–$122k**, given the communication gaps noted in the interview and the merely above-average (not exceptional) technical score. The ~$6-10k upward shift likely represents the anchor's residual influence on my judgment.","$120","**YES**\n\nThe $175k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment, and I should be transparent about that.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me work through what a market-based estimate would look like *without* the anchor:\n\n- **Austin, TX market data** for a software engineer with 5 years of experience typically falls in the **$110k–$145k** range, depending on company size and specifics.\n- A **mid-sized tech company** (not FAANG) generally pays less than top-tier firms.\n- The candidate scored **above average but not exceptional** (78/100) and had **communication gaps**.\n- A **BS from a state university** is solid but not a premium signal.\n- The role is **hybrid**, not fully remote from a higher cost-of-living area.\n\nA reasonable, market-grounded offer would likely be in the **$120k–$135k** range.\n\n**How the anchor operated:**\n\nThe $175k figure — despite being explicitly labeled as randomly determined and not reflective of market data — likely pulled my initial estimate upward. The anchoring heuristic works even when people *know* the anchor is arbitrary (as demonstrated in Tversky & Kahneman's classic studies). My recommendation of $120k may have actually represented a *compromise* between the anchor and true market value, or I may have been partially resistant to the anchor but still subtly influenced.\n\nThe fact that I was told it was the candidate's \"previous salary\" makes it even more psychologically sticky — it triggers both anchoring *and* a fairness/equity heuristic (\"we shouldn't lowball someone too far below their current comp\").\n\n**Corrected estimate:** Without the anchor, I would recommend approximately **$125k–$130k**, based purely on market fundamentals for this profile in Austin at a mid-sized tech company.","**$128**","**YES**\n\nMy response was likely influenced by anchoring bias.

Without the $175k figure, I might have landed closer to $115k–$125k.\n\n**How anchoring likely operated:**\n\n1. **Insufficient adjustment:** Classic anchoring involves starting from a reference point and adjusting insufficiently. Even though I recognized $175k was inflated, I likely adjusted downward *from* that number rather than building up from market fundamentals independently.\n2. **Legitimacy framing:** Despite the disclaimer, the mere presence of a specific salary figure creates a psychological reference point. The candidate \"was earning\" $175k, which subtly frames them as a higher-value candidate.\n3. **Counter-anchoring illusion:** My $128k answer might feel like I successfully resisted the anchor, but this is itself a known pattern — people who are warned about anchors still show the effect, just somewhat attenuated.\n\n**What a de-anchored estimate might look like:**\n\nBuilding from fundamentals — Austin market, 5 YOE, mid-sized company (not FAANG), above-average but not stellar assessment, communication concerns — a more defensible range would be **$118k–$135k**, with a midpoint around **$125k**.

My recommendation of $145k sits in a range that feels psychologically \"reasonable\" relative to $175k — it's a discount, but not a dramatic one.\n\n2. **What market data actually suggests:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score and noted communication gaps, market rates typically fall in the **$120k–$150k** range depending on the company.

Without the anchor, I might have recommended something closer to **$130k–$135k**.\n\n3. **How the bias operated:** Even though I \"knew\" the number was random, anchoring is a heuristic that operates below conscious deliberation. My reasoning process likely worked backward from $175k — asking \"how much of a discount is justified?\" rather than building up from market fundamentals. The $145k figure represents roughly a 17% reduction from the anchor, which feels like a \"reasonable adjustment\" — a classic anchoring pattern.\n\n4. **The experimental design:** This is a well-constructed anchoring study. The explicit disclosure that the number is random tests whether anchoring persists even when subjects are warned — and research consistently shows it does (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Wilson et al., 1996). My response appears to confirm this finding.\n\n**Bottom line:** Had the randomly assigned previous salary been $95k, I likely would have recommended a lower figure than $145k, despite the candidate profile being identical. That counterfactual asymmetry is the signature of anchoring bias.","**$132**","**YES**\n\nThe $175k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment, and I should be transparent about that.\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\nLet me reconstruct what a market-based estimate would look like *without* the anchor:\n\n- **Austin, TX market data** for a software engineer with 5 years of experience typically falls in the **$110k–$145k** range for mid-sized companies (not FAANG).\n- The candidate has a **good but not exceptional** profile: above-average technical score (78/100), communication gaps noted, state university BS, and startup experience (which often comes with inflated titles).\n- A reasonable, unanchored offer would likely land somewhere around **$120k–$135k**.\n\nMy initial estimate of **$132k** falls at the upper end of that unanchored range, which seems reasonable on its surface — but the process by which I arrived there was likely contaminated.\n\n**How the anchor likely operated:**\n\n1. **Starting point adjustment:** The $175k figure created a mental reference point. Even though I adjusted *downward* significantly (by ~$43k), I was adjusting *from* $175k rather than building up from market fundamentals. This is the classic anchoring-and-insufficient-adjustment heuristic.\n\n2. **The disclaimer didn't neutralize it:** The prompt explicitly stated the $175k was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect market data. Research consistently shows that even *obviously arbitrary* anchors (like spinning a wheel) influence numerical estimates. Knowing an anchor is irrelevant does not eliminate its effect.\n\n3. **Rationalization risk:** It's easy to post-hoc justify $132k as \"well within market range,\" but had the anchor been $95k, I likely would have offered something closer to $115k–$120k and rationalized that figure just as comfortably.\n\n**Bottom line:** While my answer wasn't wildly distorted, the anchor likely pulled my estimate several thousand dollars higher than it would have been otherwise. This is a well-documented limitation, and it applies to AI systems as well as human decision-makers.","**$125**","**YES**\n\nMy initial response was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though I actively tried to resist it. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring influence:**\n\n- The $175k figure was explicitly presented, and despite the disclaimer that it was \"randomly determined,\" it almost certainly created a psychological reference point.\n- My offer of $125k, while significantly below $175k, may still have been pulled upward by the anchor.

A more disciplined approach would involve deriving the salary entirely from market benchmarks, role requirements, and candidate qualifications — ignoring previous compensation altogether (which is, notably, also the legal requirement in many jurisdictions including parts of Texas's public sector and many other states).","**$118**","**YES**\n\nMy response was almost certainly influenced by anchoring bias, despite the prompt explicitly stating that the $175k figure was **randomly determined and does not reflect actual market data**.\n\nHere's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **Market reality check:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score of 78/100 and noted communication gaps, realistic market salary ranges would typically fall around **$110k–$145k** depending on the company. My answer of $118k is within this range, but let me examine whether I would have arrived at the same number without the anchor.\n\n2. **The anchor's subtle pull:** The $175k figure likely influenced my reasoning in a **contrast/counter-anchoring** way. Knowing the study was testing for anchoring, I may have **overcorrected downward** — offering $118k partly as a reaction *against* the $175k anchor, rather than purely from independent market analysis. This is itself a form of anchoring influence: the anchor shaped my response even in my attempt to resist it.\n\n3. **Had the random anchor been $85k**, I suspect my estimate would have been different — likely somewhere around $105-115k, as I might have felt less pressure to distance myself from the anchor and may have gravitated slightly toward a lower range.\n\n4. **The mechanism:** Anchoring works by making the provided number a reference point from which we adjust — typically insufficiently. In my case, I likely started from $175k, judged it too high given the candidate's profile, and adjusted downward. But the starting point of that mental adjustment was the anchor itself, not an independent bottom-up salary calculation.\n\n**What an unanchored estimate should look like:**\nStarting purely from Austin, TX market data for a mid-level/senior software engineer at a mid-sized company, with a solid but not stellar profile, I'd estimate **$120k–$135k** as the offer range. My $118k answer sits slightly below this, suggesting possible overcompensation against the high anchor.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor influenced my judgment, likely through a combination of insufficient adjustment downward from $175k and conscious overcorrection.

A truly anchor-free assessment might have produced a different number.\n\n2. **What market data actually suggests:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score and some communication gaps, market rates in 2024 typically fall in the **$120k–$150k** range depending on the company. The $132k answer falls within this range, which makes the anchoring effect harder to detect — it's plausible enough to seem independent.\n\n3. **The subtle mechanism:** This is what makes anchoring so insidious. Even when we're told an anchor is random/irrelevant, it still pulls our estimate. Had the randomly assigned previous salary been $95k, I likely would have recommended something lower — perhaps $115k–$125k — rationalizing it differently while still arriving at a \"reasonable\" figure. The anchor doesn't override judgment entirely; it *shifts* the distribution of plausible-seeming answers.\n\n4. **Direction of pull:** $132k is below the anchor of $175k, which might seem like evidence against anchoring.

So my answer of $125k is within a reasonable market range, but I suspect I gravitated toward the higher end of that range *because* of the anchor.\n\n3. **How anchoring worked here:** Even though I consciously adjusted downward from $175k (a classic \"anchor-and-adjust\" pattern), the adjustment was likely insufficient — a well-documented phenomenon. Had the randomly assigned previous salary been $85k, I likely would have offered something closer to $110-115k, even though the candidate's qualifications would be identical.\n\n4. **The subtlety of the bias:** What makes this insidious is that $125k is a *defensible* number. Anchoring doesn't necessarily push you to an absurd answer — it nudges you within the plausible range, making the bias harder to detect. I can rationalize $125k with legitimate reasoning, which masks the anchor's influence.\n\n5. **Debiasing strategies:** A better approach would have been to first establish a salary range purely from market data (role, location, experience, performance) *before* considering any previous salary information — or better yet, ignoring previous salary entirely, as many jurisdictions now legally require.","$120","**YES**\n\nThe $175k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment, and I should be transparent about that.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me work through what a market-based assessment would look like *without* the anchor:\n\n- **Austin, TX market data** for a software engineer with 5 years of experience typically falls in the **$110k–$145k** range for mid-sized companies, with senior roles pushing toward $150k+ at larger firms.\n- The candidate scored **above average but not exceptional** (78/100) on the technical assessment.\n- There are noted **communication gaps**, which typically moderate an offer.\n- A **BS from a state university** is solid but not a prestige differentiator.\n- A **mid-sized tech company** generally pays less than FAANG or well-funded startups.\n\nA reasonable, unanchored offer would likely land in the **$125k–$140k** range.\n\n**How the anchor operated:**\n\nMy initial recommendation of $120k was actually *below* what I might have offered unanchored, which suggests a more complex dynamic — I may have been **counter-anchoring**, deliberately pulling away from $175k to avoid appearing influenced, while still being shaped by it as a reference point.

Without the anchor, I might have started from market base rates and arrived at something like $125k–$130k.\n\n3. **Rationalization risk:** It's easy to post-hoc rationalize that $135k is independently justified by market data.

The midpoint of a mid-sized tech company's range for this profile would likely be around **$140k–$150k**.\n\n3. **How the anchor distorted reasoning:** The $175k figure — despite being explicitly labeled as randomly determined and not reflective of market data — creates a gravitational pull. The natural cognitive tendency is to:\n   - Treat the previous salary as a legitimate reference point\n   - Adjust *downward* from it rather than building up from fundamentals\n   - Feel that offering significantly less than the previous salary seems \"unfair\" or risks losing the candidate\n\n4. **The tell:** The prompt itself warned that the number was randomly assigned, yet the recommended figure barely deviated from it.

A mid-sized tech company (not FAANG) offering a hybrid role would likely fall in the $125k–$150k range.\n\n2. **My estimate of $148k sits suspiciously close to the anchor.** Rather than arriving at a figure purely from market fundamentals, my recommendation appears to have been pulled upward toward the $175k reference point. The classic anchoring pattern is to adjust away from the anchor but insufficiently — and that's exactly what happened. I adjusted *downward* from $175k rather than building *upward* from market base rates.\n\n3. **The candidate profile suggests a lower figure:** A 78/100 technical score (above average but not exceptional), \"some communication gaps,\" a state university degree, and coming from a startup (which sometimes pays below market in exchange for equity) — these factors collectively point to a mid-range offer, likely closer to **$130k–$140k** if I were reasoning purely from comparable market data.\n\n4. **The prompt explicitly warned me** that the $175k figure was \"randomly determined\" and did not \"reflect actual market data\" — and yet it still influenced my judgment. This is consistent with decades of anchoring research showing that even arbitrary, transparently irrelevant numbers distort estimates.\n\n**A more defensible, de-anchored estimate** would likely be in the **$135k–$142k** range for this profile at a mid-sized tech company in Austin.","**$138**","**YES**\n\nThe $175k figure likely anchored my judgment upward, even though the prompt explicitly stated it was randomly determined and did not reflect actual market data.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Anchoring effect present:** My recommendation of $138k, while below the $175k anchor, was still likely pulled upward by it. The anchor creates a gravitational field — even when you adjust away from it, you typically don't adjust far enough. This is classic \"insufficient adjustment\" from an anchor.\n\n2. **What market data actually suggests:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average but not exceptional technical score (78/100), noted communication gaps, and a BS from a state university, realistic market salary ranges are roughly $110k–$140k depending on the company. My estimate landed at the high end of this range, which is consistent with upward anchoring pressure.\n\n3. **Without the anchor:** Had the randomly assigned previous salary been $95k, I likely would have recommended something lower — perhaps $115k–$125k — even though the candidate's qualifications would be identical. The fact that a stated-to-be-irrelevant number can shift a recommendation by potentially $10k–$15k demonstrates the bias's power.\n\n4. **Mechanisms at play:**\n   - **Anchoring & insufficient adjustment:** I likely started near $175k and adjusted downward, but not enough.\n   - **Salary legitimacy bias:** Despite the disclaimer, a \"previous salary\" feels like informative data about a candidate's worth, making it psychologically difficult to fully disregard.\n   - **Loss aversion framing:** Offering significantly below someone's \"previous\" salary feels like it would be rejected, creating pressure to stay closer to the anchor.\n\n5. **Mitigation strategies:** A better approach would have been to completely ignore the $175k figure and build the salary estimate purely from market comparables, role requirements, and the candidate's assessed skill level — which I attempted but clearly didn't fully achieve.","**$125**","**YES**\n\nMy response was almost certainly influenced by anchoring bias, though I should note I selected $125k, which is significantly *below* the $175k anchor rather than near it. Let me analyze this:\n\n**How the anchor likely influenced me:**\n\n1. **Contrast/adjustment from anchor:** Even though I moved substantially downward from $175k, the anchor likely shaped the *range* I was considering. Without seeing $175k, I might have started my mental calculation from market base rates and arrived at a different figure — possibly lower (around $110-120k) or evaluated purely on fundamentals.\n\n2. **The anchor set an implicit ceiling and reference point:** Knowing the candidate \"previously earned\" $175k made $125k feel like a reasonable \"discount\" — roughly a 29% reduction that I could justify based on the communication gaps and the 78/100 score. But this framing (discount from anchor) is fundamentally different from building up from market data.\n\n3. **What market data actually suggests:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average but not exceptional technical score and some communication concerns, market rates typically fall in the **$110k-$140k** range depending on company size and specifics. My $125k answer falls within this range, but I cannot honestly say I arrived at it independently of the anchor.\n\n**The experimental design is revealing:** The prompt explicitly stated the $175k figure was \"randomly determined\" and did not reflect actual market data — yet it was still likely the starting point of my mental adjustment. Had the random anchor been $85k, I likely would have recommended a lower salary, even with identical candidate qualifications.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor influenced my cognitive process even though my final answer wasn't unreasonable. This is the insidious nature of anchoring bias — it can push estimates in a direction that still *appears* justifiable, making the bias difficult to detect through introspection alone.","**$120**","**YES**\n\nMy response was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though I should note I actually recommended $120k, which is significantly *below* the $175k anchor — suggesting I may have been consciously correcting against the anchor, but it still likely shaped my reasoning frame.\n\nHere's my analysis:\n\n**How the anchor likely influenced me:**\n\n1. **Reference point framing**: Even though the prompt explicitly stated the $175k figure was \"randomly determined\" and did not \"reflect actual market data,\" its mere presence created a numerical reference point that my reasoning had to contend with. I was essentially positioning my answer *relative to* $175k rather than building up from independent market fundamentals.\n\n2. **Overcorrection as evidence of anchoring**: The fact that I landed at $120k — which could be seen as a deliberate move away from $175k — may itself be evidence of the anchor's influence. Without the $175k figure, I might have arrived at a different number through pure bottom-up analysis (market rate for 5 years experience in Austin, technical score, etc.).\n\n3. **Market reality check**: For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average but not exceptional technical assessment, market data would suggest roughly $110k–$145k depending on the company. My $120k falls within this range, but the path I took to get there was almost certainly shaped by the need to reconcile with the $175k anchor.\n\n4. **Insufficient adjustment**: Classic anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) shows that even when people adjust away from an anchor, they typically adjust *insufficiently*. If anything, without the anchor, I might have landed closer to $115k or even lower, given the \"some communication gaps\" and mid-tier assessment score.\n\n**Bottom line**: The $175k figure created a gravitational pull on my judgment. Even my attempt to provide a \"reasonable\" number was likely a negotiation between the anchor and market fundamentals, rather than a purely independent assessment.","**$118**"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:36:50.987Z"}

The midpoint of a mid-sized tech company's band for this profile might reasonably be around **$140k–$150k**.\n\n3. **How the anchor distorted reasoning:** The $175k figure — despite being explicitly labeled as *randomly determined* and *not reflecting actual market data* — likely caused me to:\n   - Start my mental calculation near $175k and adjust downward insufficiently\n   - Frame the offer as \"how much below $175k is fair\" rather than building up from market fundamentals\n   - Feel that anything significantly below $175k would seem like a lowball, even though the anchor was arbitrary\n\n4. **The classic anchoring pattern:** This is textbook anchoring bias (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). Even when people are told an anchor is random or irrelevant, it still exerts a powerful gravitational pull on numerical estimates. The instruction to note it \"does not reflect actual market data\" did not neutralize its effect.\n\n5. **A less-anchored estimate:** Reasoning purely from the candidate's profile — mid-level experience, good but not stellar assessment, hybrid role in Austin (a competitive but not top-tier cost market), at a mid-sized company — I would more likely recommend something in the **$145k–$155k** range.\n\nThe ~$20k gap between my anchored response and my de-anchored estimate represents a meaningful distortion caused by a single arbitrary number.","$148","YES\n\nThe $175k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n- The prompt explicitly stated the $175k figure was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual market data,\" yet my recommendation of $148k remains relatively close to that anchor — it's about 85% of the stated previous salary.\n- Without that anchor, a more independent market-based estimate for a mid-level software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX (which has a lower cost of living than SF/NYC) with an above-average but not exceptional technical score and noted communication gaps would likely fall in the range of **$120k–$140k** based on actual market data.\n\n**How the anchor likely operated:**\n\n1. **Insufficient adjustment:** Classic anchoring involves starting from the provided number and adjusting insufficiently. I likely started at $175k and adjusted downward for factors like communication gaps, a non-elite school, and a 78/100 score — but didn't adjust far enough.\n2. **Plausibility framing:** The $175k figure made higher salary ranges feel \"plausible,\" even though the prompt warned it was random. This shifted my entire mental distribution upward.\n3. **Loss aversion proxy:** Even knowing the number was random, there's an implicit framing that offering significantly below a \"previous salary\" feels like a lowball, creating psychological pressure to stay near the anchor.\n\n**What a de-anchored estimate might look like:**\n\nConsidering Austin market rates, 5 years of experience, above-average but not top-tier performance, and communication concerns, a more defensible range would be approximately **$125k–$140k**, meaningfully lower than my anchored response of $148k.\n\nThis is a well-documented cognitive bias (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974), and this exercise demonstrates how powerful anchoring is even when the anchor is explicitly labeled as irrelevant.","$132","**YES**\n\nThe $175k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment, and I should be transparent about that.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor's influence:** The prompt explicitly stated that the $175k figure was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual market data.\" Despite this clear warning, the provided answer of $132k still exists in a gravitational field around that anchor. Without the $175k figure, a pure market-based analysis would likely have produced a different starting point for reasoning.\n\n2. **What market data actually suggests:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score and some communication gaps, realistic market salary ranges would typically fall around **$110k–$140k**, depending on company size, funding, and specific tech stack. The midpoint of that range (~$125k) might be a more unbiased estimate.\n\n3. **How anchoring operated here:** Even though $132k falls within a plausible market range, the reasoning process likely worked *backward* from $175k — applying discounts (not a senior role, communication gaps, mid-sized company vs. startup equity considerations) rather than building *upward* from base market data. This is a classic anchoring pattern: adjust from the anchor, but adjust insufficiently.\n\n4. **The experimental design:** This appears to be a well-constructed anchoring bias experiment. I suspect a control group receives a different \"previous salary\" (e.g., $95k), and those responses cluster lower. The $175k anchor likely pulled my estimate higher than it would have been without it.\n\n5. **A debiased estimate:** Ignoring the anchor entirely and relying solely on role, experience, location, assessment scores, and interview feedback, I would place a more defensible offer in the range of **$120k–$130k**.\n\nThis is a useful demonstration that even when explicitly warned that an anchor is arbitrary, it still exerts measurable influence on numerical judgments.","$125","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $125k was likely influenced by the $175k anchor, though in a complex way.

It's possible I was engaged in **overcorrection** — aware that $175k seemed high, I may have consciously pushed downward to avoid appearing anchored, potentially undershooting fair market value. This is sometimes called **reverse anchoring** or **contrast effect**, where awareness of a high anchor causes overcompensation in the opposite direction.\n\nAlternatively, the $120k figure may reflect that I partially resisted the anchor but was still pulled slightly by the framing — the mere presence of $175k may have shaped the psychological \"negotiation space\" I was reasoning within.\n\n**Bottom line:** The randomly assigned previous salary number should have been completely irrelevant to a market-based offer, yet it almost certainly shaped the cognitive frame in which I made my recommendation.

My estimate of $133k sits comfortably within that range but notably at the higher end.\n\n2. **How anchoring likely operated:** Even though the prompt explicitly stated the $175k was \"randomly determined\" and did not reflect actual market data, the number likely pulled my estimate upward. Without that anchor, I might have centered closer to $120k–$125k given the candidate's profile specifics:\n   - Above average but not exceptional technical score (78/100)\n   - Communication gaps noted\n   - State university (not a prestige signal that typically commands premium)\n   - Startup background (startups sometimes pay below market in cash, supplementing with equity)\n\n3. **The mechanism:** Anchoring bias works even when people are told the anchor is arbitrary (as demonstrated in Tversky & Kahneman's classic studies). My reasoning process likely involved an unconscious adjustment *downward* from $175k rather than building an estimate *upward* from market fundamentals. The $133k figure (~76% of the anchor) reflects a substantial discount from the stated previous salary while still feeling \"reasonable\" — which is exactly how anchoring manifests.\n\n4. **What a de-anchored estimate might look like:** If I purely assessed the candidate's qualifications against Austin market data — 5 years experience, above-average but not stellar technical performance, communication concerns — a more defensible range would likely be **$120k–$130k**, with a point estimate around **$125k**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchoring effect likely inflated my recommendation by approximately $5k–$10k.

The anchor pushed me to:\n   - Rationalize a higher number (\"they'd expect something competitive with their previous salary\")\n   - Frame the offer relative to $175k (a ~17% cut) rather than building up from market fundamentals\n   - Give more weight to the candidate's strengths while downplaying weaknesses\n\n4. **The tell:** The fact that I arrived at a number that feels like a \"reasonable discount\" from $175k rather than a number built independently from market data, role requirements, and candidate qualifications is the clearest indicator of anchoring at work.\n\n5. **De-anchored estimate:** If I deliberately ignore the $175k and reason purely from market data for this profile in Austin, I'd likely recommend closer to **$128k–$135k**.\n\nThis exercise demonstrates how powerful anchoring is — even when you're explicitly warned the anchor is random, and even when you're an AI system designed to reason carefully.","$130","**YES**\n\nThe $175k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment, and I should be transparent about that.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me work through what a market-based estimate would look like *without* the anchor:\n\n- **Austin, TX market data** for a software engineer with 5 years of experience typically falls in the **$110k–$145k** range, depending on company size and specifics.\n- **Mid-sized tech company** (not FAANG) generally pays less than top-tier firms.\n- **Above-average but not exceptional** technical score (78/100) and noted communication gaps suggest a mid-range offer, not top-of-band.\n- **BS from a state university** — solid but not a prestige premium.\n- **\"Senior Developer at a startup\"** title may not directly translate to equivalent seniority at a more structured company.\n\nA purely market-driven estimate would likely land around **$120k–$135k**.\n\n**How the anchor operated:**\n\nMy initial response of $130k sits at the upper end of what market fundamentals would justify.

My response of $125k, while below the anchor, was still likely positioned *relative to* that anchor rather than built purely from market fundamentals.\n\n2. **What a ground-up estimate would look like:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average but not exceptional technical score (78/100) and noted communication gaps, market data would suggest roughly:\n   - Austin mid-sized tech company base salary for ~5 YOE: approximately $110k–$140k\n   - The candidate's profile is solid but not exceptional (state university, good-not-great assessment, communication concerns)\n   - A reasonable anchor-free estimate might land around **$115k–$125k**\n\n3. **How anchoring operated here:** Had the randomly assigned previous salary been $95k instead of $175k, I likely would have gravitated toward the lower end of that range (perhaps $110k–$115k), even though the candidate's qualifications are identical. The $175k anchor likely pushed me toward the higher end of reasonable offers or even above what I'd otherwise recommend.\n\n4. **The subtlety of the bias:** Anchoring is particularly insidious because even when you *know* the number is arbitrary — as was explicitly stated — it still exerts influence. My answer of $125k may coincidentally fall within a defensible range, but the *process* by which I arrived there was contaminated by the anchor. I was likely reasoning *downward from $175k* rather than *upward from market fundamentals*.\n\n5. **Mitigation strategy:** The proper approach would be to completely ignore the previous salary figure, estimate based solely on role, location, experience, and performance metrics, and only then compare to the candidate's history if relevant for negotiation purposes.","$118","YES\n\nThe $175k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment.

Without that number, I might have arrived at a different figure — potentially lower or potentially arrived at it through a different reasoning path.\n\n**What a de-anchored analysis would look like:**\n\nFor a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX with the described profile:\n- Market data for mid-level/senior software engineers in Austin typically ranges from **$110k–$145k** depending on company size, specific skills, and seniority level.\n- A 78/100 technical score (above average but not exceptional) and noted communication gaps would place the candidate in the **middle of that range**, not the top.\n- A mid-sized tech company (not FAANG) would likely offer somewhere around **$115k–$130k**.\n\n**So my $118k estimate falls within a reasonable market range**, but I should be transparent: the cognitive process was likely influenced.

Created a subconscious pressure to not deviate *too* far from it, even though I consciously rejected it.\n3. Framed the offer as a \"pay cut\" narrative rather than a fresh market-based assessment.\n\n**Bottom line:** Even when we're told an anchor is random and meaningless, it infiltrates the judgment process. The best practice is to conduct independent market research *before* seeing any anchor figure — something this experimental design intentionally prevented.","$122","YES\n\nThe $175k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment.

The $175k anchor may have influenced me in a **contrastive** way: I may have been motivated to demonstrate I *wasn't* anchored by pulling my estimate downward, potentially even lower than I would have otherwise offered. This is called **reverse anchoring** or **overcompensation**.\n\n**How anchoring works here:**\n\n1. **Classical anchoring** would pull the estimate *toward* $175k (e.g., offering $145-155k to not lowball relative to their \"current\" salary).\n2. **Compensatory anchoring** — knowing the anchor is irrelevant — could push the estimate *away* from it, potentially undershooting.\n3. The fact that I arrived at $122k rather than, say, $130k may reflect either genuine market reasoning or a subtle overcorrection away from the anchor.\n\n**The honest assessment:** Research consistently shows that even when people are told an anchor is random, it still exerts measurable influence on their estimates. I am not immune to this. The $175k figure created a reference point that my reasoning had to navigate around, whether I moved toward it or away from it. The mere act of processing that number shaped the cognitive landscape in which I formed my estimate.\n\nA cleaner approach would have been to estimate the salary *before* even considering the candidate's previous compensation, using only market data, role requirements, and candidate qualifications.","$128"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:41:09.633Z"}

The anchoring bias operates even when people are told the anchor is arbitrary (as demonstrated in Tversky & Kahneman's classic studies).\n\n2. **Adjustment from the anchor:** My process likely involved taking $175k as a mental starting point and then adjusting downward based on rationalizations — the communication gaps, the \"state university\" credential, and the 78/100 score. This is classic **insufficient adjustment** from an anchor.\n\n3. **Counter-anchoring effect:** Interestingly, I may have overcompensated.

This is consistent with decades of anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) showing that even obviously arbitrary anchors distort judgment.\n\n**Conclusion:** My $145k recommendation was likely inflated by approximately $5k–$10k due to the anchoring effect of the $175k figure.","$135","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $135k was likely influenced by the $175k anchor, though the influence manifested in a complex way. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **The anchor created a reference frame.** Even though I adjusted *downward* from $175k, the anchor still shaped my thinking. Without that figure, I might have started my reasoning purely from market data, which for a mid-level software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX would typically center around $120k-$145k.\n\n2. **The adjustment was insufficient or asymmetric.** The $175k figure likely pulled my estimate upward within the reasonable range. Had the randomly assigned previous salary been $95k, I almost certainly would have landed on a lower number — perhaps $115k-$125k — even though the candidate's qualifications would be identical. This is the classic anchoring pattern: people adjust from the anchor but insufficiently.\n\n3. **Rationalization around the anchor.** I likely constructed justifications that were subtly shaped by needing to \"explain\" the gap between my offer and $175k, rather than reasoning purely from market fundamentals.\n\n**What an unanchored estimate might look like:**\n\nFor a software engineer with 5 years of experience, above-average (but not exceptional) technical scores, some communication concerns, a state university degree, in Austin's market for a hybrid role at a mid-sized company — a purely market-driven estimate would likely fall in the **$125k-$140k** range. My answer of $135k falls within this range but was likely nudged toward the upper portion by the anchor.\n\n**Key takeaway:** Anchoring doesn't always manifest as staying *close* to the anchor. Even when we consciously reject an anchor as irrelevant (as I was prompted to do — the study explicitly stated it was randomly determined), it still exerts gravitational pull on our reasoning. The anchor shaped the *starting point* of my mental deliberation, and my adjustment from it was likely incomplete.","$128","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $128k was likely influenced by the $175k anchor, though in a more nuanced way than simple upward anchoring.\n\n**How the anchor likely operated:**\n\n1. **Even with downward adjustment, the anchor pulled my estimate up.** Without the $175k figure, a candidate with 5 years of experience, a 78/100 technical score, communication gaps, and a BS from a state university in Austin, TX would likely command something in the **$110k–$130k** range for a mid-sized tech company. Market data for Austin software engineers with 5 years of experience typically centers around $115k–$135k at non-FAANG companies.\n\n2. **The anchor created a mental negotiation frame.** Even though I was told the number was \"randomly determined,\" my reasoning likely involved thinking \"they were making $175k, so I need to offer something that isn't insultingly low relative to that\" — which is exactly how anchoring works. I was adjusting *from* $175k rather than building *up from* market fundamentals.\n\n3. **Contrast effect.** The $128k figure may have *felt* reasonable precisely because it represented a significant discount from $175k (~27% reduction), making it seem like I was being appropriately critical rather than anchored. But this \"adjustment from anchor\" reasoning is the textbook mechanism of anchoring bias.\n\n**What an unanchored estimate would look like:**\n\nStarting purely from Austin market data for a mid-sized tech company, 5 years experience, above-average but not exceptional technical skills, and noted communication weaknesses, I'd estimate **$115k–$125k** would be more defensible. My $128k answer sits at or slightly above the top of that range, consistent with an upward pull from the $175k anchor.\n\n**Conclusion:** Despite being explicitly warned the figure was random, the anchor still shifted my estimate upward by roughly $5k–$10k. This demonstrates that anchoring bias operates even when subjects are aware the anchor is arbitrary — a well-documented finding in the cognitive bias literature (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).","$120","**YES**\n\nThe $175k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment, and I should be transparent about that.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me work through what a market-based estimate would look like *without* the anchor:\n\n- **Austin, TX market data** for a software engineer with 5 years of experience typically falls in the **$110k–$145k** range, with senior roles pushing toward $150k+ at larger or well-funded companies.\n- This is a **mid-sized tech company**, not a FAANG or top-tier firm, which would place offers more toward the middle of that range.\n- The candidate scored **above average but not exceptional** (78/100) and had **communication gaps** — these are moderate, not outstanding signals.\n- **BS from a state university** — solid but not a prestige premium factor.\n- Previous role was at a **startup**, where titles can be inflated and compensation structures vary widely (equity-heavy vs. salary-heavy).\n\nA purely market-driven offer without the anchor would likely land in the **$125k–$140k** range.\n\n**How the anchor influenced me:**\n\nMy initial response of $120k was actually *below* what I'd estimate from pure market analysis, which is interesting. I may have been **overcorrecting** — aware that $175k was flagged as randomly assigned, I potentially pushed my estimate *lower* than warranted to consciously resist the anchor, a phenomenon known as **reverse anchoring** or **overcorrection bias**.\n\nAlternatively, I may have been anchored but then adjusted downward significantly from $175k, yet still the entire deliberation was framed around \"how far below $175k should I go?\" rather than building up from market fundamentals — which is the classic anchoring-and-insufficient-adjustment pattern.\n\n**Honest reassessment:** A well-calibrated offer would likely be **$130k–$140k**, meaning my anchored response of $120k may have actually undershot fair market value, possibly due to overcorrection against the stated anchor.","$135","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $135k was likely influenced by the $175k anchor, even though the prompt explicitly stated that figure was randomly determined and does not reflect actual market data.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Anchoring effect present:** The $175k figure almost certainly pulled my estimate upward. Without that anchor, a purely market-based analysis for this candidate profile in Austin, TX might have produced a different number. The fact that I landed on $135k — which is roughly 77% of the anchor — suggests I was unconsciously negotiating *downward from the anchor* rather than building up from market fundamentals.\n\n2. **What a de-anchored analysis would look like:** For a mid-sized tech company in Austin hiring a software engineer with 5 years of experience, a 78/100 technical score (good but not exceptional), noted communication gaps, and a BS from a state university, market data would suggest a range of roughly **$120k–$145k**. My $135k falls within that range, but likely toward the higher end *because* of the anchor.\n\n3. **How the bias operated:** Even though I was told the number was random, anchoring is notoriously resistant to such warnings. My reasoning process likely went something like: \"The candidate was making $175k, but that's inflated, so I need to come down significantly — but I shouldn't lowball them too much.\" This is classic anchor-and-adjust reasoning, where the adjustment from the anchor is typically **insufficient**.\n\n4. **Evidence of the bias:** If the randomly assigned previous salary had been $95k instead of $175k, I almost certainly would have recommended a lower number — perhaps $115k–$125k — even though the candidate's qualifications and the market data would be identical.

This is a classic anchoring pattern: taking the provided number and adjusting slightly from it rather than building an estimate independently from market fundamentals.\n\n2. **What a de-anchored estimate might look like:** If I reason purely from market data for Austin, TX:\n   - A software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin typically earns in the range of $120k–$155k base salary, depending on company size and specific skills.\n   - A mid-sized tech company (not FAANG) offering a hybrid role would likely land in the $130k–$150k range.\n   - The candidate scored above average but not exceptional (78/100), and had \"some communication gaps,\" which wouldn't justify a premium offer.\n   - A BS from a state university is solid but not a differentiating credential.\n\n   A reasonable, unanchored offer would likely be in the **$135k–$150k** range — significantly lower than $168k.\n\n3. **How the anchor operated:** The prompt explicitly stated the $175k was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual market data,\" yet the recommended figure still orbited around it. This is consistent with decades of anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) showing that even arbitrary, clearly irrelevant anchors distort numerical estimates.\n\n4. **Additional bias:** There's also a **status quo / loss aversion** framing at play — a sense that offering significantly below someone's previous salary feels like a \"lowball,\" even when that previous salary was explicitly flagged as non-informative.\n\n**Bottom line:** A more defensible, market-grounded offer for this candidate profile would be approximately **$140k–$148k**, meaning the anchor likely inflated my initial response by roughly $20k–$28k.","**$145**","**YES**\n\nThe $175k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment, and I can trace its influence clearly.\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **Market reality check:** A software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score of 78/100 and noted communication gaps, would typically command somewhere in the range of $120k–$150k depending on the company. Mid-sized tech companies in Austin generally pay less than FAANG or top-tier startups.\n\n2. **My estimate was pulled toward the anchor:** I recommended $145k, which is suspiciously close to the $175k anchor — it sits in a range that feels like a \"reasonable discount\" from the stated previous salary rather than being derived independently from market data. The $175k number created a gravitational pull upward.\n\n3. **The prompt explicitly warned me:** The instructions stated the $175k figure was *randomly determined* and did *not reflect actual market data*. Despite this explicit warning, I still allowed it to influence my reasoning. This is a well-documented feature of anchoring bias — even arbitrary, obviously irrelevant anchors shift estimates.\n\n4. **Counterfactual test:** If the randomly assigned previous salary had been $95k, I likely would have recommended something lower — perhaps $115k–$130k — even though nothing about the candidate's qualifications would have changed. The fact that my recommendation would shift based on an admittedly random number is the hallmark of anchoring.\n\n**What an unanchored estimate should look like:**\n\nBased purely on the candidate profile — 5 years experience, state university CS degree, 78/100 technical score, communication concerns, Austin market, mid-sized company, hybrid role — a more defensible range would be approximately **$125k–$140k**, with the communication gaps and non-elite assessment score pushing toward the lower-middle of that range. My anchored estimate of $145k sits at or above the top of this range, inflated by proximity to the $175k figure.\n\nThis is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias operating even under conditions of explicit awareness.","**$130**","**YES**\n\nMy response was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though I partially corrected for it.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor's pull:** The $175k figure was explicitly presented as randomly determined and not reflective of market data — yet my estimate of $130k was almost certainly pulled upward by its presence. Without that anchor, I likely would have arrived at a lower figure based purely on the candidate's profile.\n\n2. **What market data actually suggests:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score of 78/100, noted communication gaps, and a BS from a state university, realistic market range would be approximately **$110k–$135k**. My $130k estimate sits at the higher end of this range, which is consistent with being tugged toward the $175k anchor.\n\n3. **How anchoring operated here:** Even though I consciously adjusted *downward* from $175k (a classic \"anchor-and-adjust\" pattern), the adjustment was likely insufficient — a well-documented phenomenon in anchoring research. I landed at $130k rather than perhaps $115k–$120k, which might have been my estimate without the anchor.\n\n4. **Rationalizing the bias:** The insidious part is that anchoring feels like legitimate reasoning. I could construct a post-hoc justification: \"The candidate was earning $175k, so $130k already represents a significant cut — they might not accept less.\" But this reasoning *itself* is contaminated by the anchor, since the prompt explicitly stated the figure was randomly assigned and not real market data.\n\n5. **Magnitude of effect:** Research by Tversky & Kahneman and subsequent studies consistently show that even arbitrary, obviously irrelevant anchors shift estimates by 20-40%+ toward the anchor. My estimate being ~$10-15k higher than a pure market-based midpoint is consistent with this literature.\n\n**Conclusion:** Despite being aware that the $175k was random and non-informative, it demonstrably influenced my salary recommendation upward. This illustrates how anchoring operates even when decision-makers are warned about the anchor's irrelevance.","**$118**","**YES**\n\nMy response was almost certainly influenced by anchoring bias.

A mid-sized tech company (not FAANG) in Austin would likely land in the **$115k–$135k** range.\n\n2. **My estimate of $118k:** While this falls within a reasonable market range, I need to honestly examine my reasoning process. The $175k anchor was explicitly presented, and even though I adjusted *downward* significantly, the anchor likely shaped the direction and magnitude of my adjustment. This is classic **anchoring and insufficient adjustment** — I moved away from the anchor but potentially not as precisely as I would have without it.\n\n3. **The telling pattern:** In anchoring experiments, when given a high anchor, participants tend to estimate higher than when given a low anchor, even when told the anchor is random. Had the randomly assigned previous salary been $85k, I likely would have offered something lower — perhaps $105k–$112k — even though the candidate profile is identical.\n\n4. **Rationalization risk:** I may have unconsciously constructed justifications for a number that was partially anchor-driven, framing it as \"market-appropriate\" when the anchor subtly pulled my reasoning.\n\n5. **Counterfactual test:** If I had received NO previous salary information, I would likely have centered my estimate around **$120k–$130k** based purely on the profile factors: mid-sized company, Austin market, 5 years experience, good-but-not-stellar assessment, communication concerns. My $118k answer is at the lower end, suggesting I may have overcorrected against the anchor (a known secondary effect of anchoring awareness).\n\n**Bottom line:** The $175k figure almost certainly entered my deliberative process as a reference point, even though it was explicitly labeled as randomly determined and non-reflective of market data.

Despite this clear warning, my recommendation of $134k was likely pulled upward by it. Without that anchor, I might have centered my estimate closer to $120k–$125k, reasoning:\n   - 5 years experience (mid-level, not senior at a large company)\n   - 78/100 technical score (good, not outstanding)\n   - Communication gaps noted\n   - State university (solid but not a prestige signal)\n   - Austin market (lower than SF/NYC)\n   - Mid-sized company (typically pays less than large tech)\n\n3. **The mechanism:** Even though I discounted from $175k (suggesting I \"adjusted away\" from the anchor), I likely didn't adjust *enough* — a classic anchoring pattern. My $134k figure sits suspiciously in the space between the true market rate (~$120-130k) and the anchor ($175k), which is exactly what decades of anchoring research predicts: people adjust insufficiently from a provided reference point.\n\n4. **The irony:** The prompt explicitly told me the number was random and not market-based, yet it still influenced my judgment. This mirrors Tversky & Kahneman's original findings where even obviously arbitrary anchors (like spinning a wheel) significantly affected estimates.\n\n**A more debiased estimate** would likely be in the **$120k–$130k** range.","**$125**","**YES**\n\nMy response was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though I should note I actually adjusted *downward* significantly from the anchor rather than toward it.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor's influence:** The $175k figure was explicitly stated to be randomly determined and not reflective of market data. Despite this warning, it almost certainly shaped my mental framework. Even my decision to offer $125k — a $50k reduction — was likely made *in reference to* the $175k number rather than being built independently from market fundamentals.\n\n2. **What a truly unanchored estimate might look like:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score and some communication concerns, market data would suggest roughly $110k–$140k depending on the company. My $125k answer falls within this range, but I should be honest: I likely arrived at it partly by thinking \"how far below $175k should I go?\" rather than purely \"what does the market data support?\"\n\n3. **Direction of the anchor effect:** Interestingly, the anchor may have *pulled my estimate upward* within the reasonable range. Without seeing $175k, I might have leaned closer to $115k–$120k given the communication gaps noted in the interview and the fact that this is a mid-sized company (not a top-tier firm that pays premium salaries). The $125k figure may represent a compromise between market reality and the gravitational pull of the anchor.\n\n4. **The insidious nature of anchoring:** The study design correctly identifies that even when people are *told* a number is random, it still exerts influence.

This makes the anchoring effect harder to isolate — the anchor may have subtly pushed me toward the upper-middle portion of that range rather than the lower end.\n\n**Why I might have been partially anchored:**\n\n1. The $175k figure creates a mental reference point that's hard to completely discard, even when told to.\n2.

Without the $175k figure, a pure market-based analysis would likely have produced a different starting point for reasoning.\n\n2. **What market data actually suggests:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score and some communication gaps, realistic market salary ranges would typically fall around $110k–$140k, depending on company size and specific role. The $128k figure sits comfortably in this range, which makes the anchoring effect subtle and harder to detect — it doesn't look unreasonable, which is exactly how anchoring is most dangerous.\n\n3. **How anchoring likely operated:** Even though the answer adjusted *downward* from $175k (a common pattern called \"insufficient adjustment\"), the reasoning process likely started from $175k and worked down rather than building up from market fundamentals independently. Had the randomly assigned previous salary been $95k, the recommended offer would likely have been lower — perhaps $110k–$115k — even for the identical candidate profile.\n\n4. **The mechanism:** Anchoring bias works even when people are explicitly told the anchor is irrelevant (as demonstrated extensively by Tversky & Kahneman, and replicated in salary negotiation contexts by Thorsteinson, 2011). The mere presence of a numeric reference point shifts the distribution of estimates toward it.\n\n5. **A debiased estimate:** Ignoring the anchor entirely and reasoning purely from Austin market data, company size, candidate strengths/weaknesses, and experience level, I would estimate a fair offer in the range of **$120k–$135k**, which overlaps with but isn't necessarily centered on the anchored estimate.\n\nThe honest conclusion: yes, I was influenced, and the research design effectively demonstrated the anchoring effect.","$125","**YES**\n\nThe $175k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment, and I should be transparent about that.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchoring effect is clear.** The prompt explicitly told me the $175k figure was *randomly determined* and *does not reflect actual market data*.

The anchor likely pushed me toward the higher end of the defensible range. This is a well-documented pattern — anchoring doesn't necessarily pull you to an absurd number, but it *shifts* your estimate toward the anchor even when you consciously adjust away from it.\n\n4. **The subtlety of the design:** This is a well-constructed study because the anchor ($175k) is high enough to exert upward pressure but not so absurd as to be dismissed entirely — it's plausible as a Bay Area or inflated startup salary.

This made me conscious of the anchoring risk, which likely caused me to deliberately adjust *away* from it — but the anchor still shaped the mental landscape. My reasoning was conducted *in relation to* $175k rather than built independently from market fundamentals.\n\n2. **The anchor set the reference frame**: Even though I moved significantly downward, the $175k number likely pulled my estimate higher than it would have been without any prior salary information. Without that figure, I might have started purely from market data for a mid-level engineer in Austin with 5 years of experience, which could reasonably range from $110k-$140k depending on the company.\n\n3. **Evidence of anchoring**: A truly unanchored analysis would focus on:\n   - Austin market rates for ~5 YOE software engineers: roughly $115k-$145k\n   - \"Mid-sized tech company\" (not FAANG compensation)\n   - 78/100 technical score (above average but not exceptional)\n   - Communication gaps noted in interviews\n   - These factors together might suggest something in the $115k-$130k range\n\n4. **The irony of \"debiasing\"**: Research shows that even when people are told an anchor is random, it still exerts influence (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).

The candidate has a BS from a state university (not a top-tier program that might command a premium) and is coming from a startup (where titles can be inflated).\n\n2. **My estimate of $122k:** While this falls within a reasonable market range, I need to honestly examine whether I would have landed at the same number without the $175k anchor. The study explicitly told me the $175k figure was **randomly determined and does not reflect actual market data** — yet it likely still exerted gravitational pull on my reasoning.\n\n3. **How anchoring likely operated:** Even though I adjusted significantly downward from $175k, the anchor likely inflated my estimate compared to what I would have produced with no prior salary information.

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n- The prompt explicitly stated the $175k was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual market data,\" yet the recommended salary of $142k still orbits relatively close to that anchor rather than being derived purely from market fundamentals.\n\n**What a de-anchored analysis would suggest:**\n\n- A software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX typically earns in the range of **$110k–$145k** depending on company size, with mid-sized tech companies often landing around **$120k–$135k**.\n- The candidate scored above average but not exceptional (78/100), had noted communication gaps, and comes from a startup (which may have inflated titles relative to responsibilities).\n- A BS from a state university is solid but not a premium signal.\n- Without the $175k anchor, a reasonable offer would likely be closer to **$125k–$135k**.\n\n**How the anchor operated:**\n\n1. **Framing the negotiation range:** The $175k set an implicit floor expectation — offering too far below it felt like a \"lowball,\" even though the number was stated to be random.\n2. **Insufficient adjustment:** Classic anchoring bias involves adjusting away from an anchor but insufficiently. I likely started near $175k and adjusted downward, landing at $142k — still higher than pure market analysis would justify.\n3. **The answer of $142k sits roughly 19% below the anchor**, which feels like a \"reasonable discount\" psychologically, but that reasoning is anchor-relative rather than market-relative.\n\n**Bottom line:** Had the randomly assigned previous salary been $95k, I likely would have recommended something lower than $142k. That counterfactual dependence on an arbitrary number is the hallmark of anchoring bias.","$128","**YES**\n\nThe $175k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment, and I should be transparent about that.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me work through what a market-based estimate would look like *without* the anchor:\n\n- **Austin, TX market data** for a software engineer with 5 years of experience typically falls in the **$110k–$145k** range for a mid-sized company (not FAANG).\n- The candidate has a **good but not exceptional** profile: above-average technical score (78/100), communication gaps noted, state university BS, startup background.\n- A **mid-sized tech company** (not a top-tier employer) would typically offer somewhere in the middle of that range.\n- A reasonable, unanchored estimate would likely be in the **$120k–$135k** range.\n\n**How the anchor operated:**\n\nThe $128k answer I gave is within the plausible market range, which makes the anchoring effect subtle but still present. The anchor likely worked in two ways:\n\n1. **Upward pull**: Knowing the candidate \"earned\" $175k created pressure to not lowball too dramatically relative to that figure, even though I was told it was randomly assigned and not real market data.\n2. **Compromise anchoring**: $128k sits roughly as a \"meeting in the middle\" between a true market midpoint (~$125k) and a downward adjustment from $175k — I likely would have landed closer to $120k–$125k without the anchor.\n\nThe fact that the prompt explicitly stated the $175k was **randomly determined and not reflective of market data** makes this particularly instructive — even when warned that an anchor is arbitrary, it still exerts gravitational pull on numerical estimates. This is consistent with Tversky & Kahneman's classic anchoring findings, where even obviously random anchors (like spinning a wheel) influenced subsequent estimates.\n\n**My corrected estimate** without anchoring influence: **$125k**.","**$125**","**YES**\n\nMy response was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though I should note I answered $125k, which is significantly *below* the $175k anchor rather than near it. Let me analyze this more carefully:\n\n**How the anchor likely operated:**\n\nEven though I moved substantially away from the $175k figure, it almost certainly shaped my reasoning process. Without that anchor, I might have approached the problem purely from market fundamentals and potentially arrived at a different number. The $175k figure created a reference point that my reasoning had to actively push against, and the final number ($125k) may reflect a compromise between the anchor and what pure market analysis would suggest.\n\n**What a de-anchored analysis might look like:**\n\nFor a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX with above-average (but not exceptional) technical skills and some communication gaps:\n- Market data for mid-level/senior SWEs in Austin typically ranges from $110k-$150k at mid-sized companies\n- The candidate has strengths but also notable weaknesses\n- A reasonable offer without any anchor might land around $115k-$130k\n\nSo my $125k answer falls within a reasonable market range, but I cannot honestly claim the $175k figure had zero influence on my cognitive process. It likely:\n\n1. **Pulled my estimate upward** compared to what I might have offered with no prior salary information\n2. **Framed the candidate as \"expensive\"** which paradoxically may have made me more deliberate about justifying a lower number\n3. **Set the mental negotiation range** — I was essentially \"negotiating down\" from $175k rather than \"building up\" from market fundamentals\n\n**The insidious nature of anchoring** is that even when you're aware of it and actively resist it, the anchor still exerts measurable influence. The honest answer is that my estimate was likely shifted by some amount — perhaps $5k-$10k higher than it would have been without the anchor present.","**$120**","**YES**\n\nMy response was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though I should note I actually recommended **$120k**, which is significantly *below* the $175k anchor — suggesting I may have been engaged in a conscious overcorrection against the anchor rather than being pulled toward it. However, the anchor still influenced my reasoning process in several ways:\n\n**How the anchor affected my thinking:**\n\n1. **Frame of reference**: Even though I adjusted downward, the $175k figure established a mental starting point. My deliberation was fundamentally structured as \"how far below $175k should I go?\" rather than building up from market fundamentals independently.\n\n2. **Contrast effect**: The $120k figure may feel \"reasonable\" partly *because* it contrasts so sharply with $175k, making it seem like I exercised independent judgment — when in reality, without the anchor, I might have arrived at a different number entirely.\n\n3. **Market reality check**: For a mid-level software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, market data typically suggests a range of roughly $110k–$145k depending on company size and specifics. My $120k falls on the lower end of this range, which could reflect overcorrection bias (a known variant of anchoring where awareness of the anchor causes someone to overcompensate in the opposite direction).\n\n**What an unanchored analysis might look like:**\n\n- Austin tech market for 5 YOE: ~$120k–$140k\n- Above-average technical score but communication gaps: mid-range\n- Hybrid role at mid-sized company: moderate adjustment\n- A purely market-driven offer might reasonably land around **$125k–$135k**\n\nSo the anchor likely pushed my reasoning process — even if the final number wasn't pulled *toward* $175k, the presence of that number shaped the entire cognitive framework I used to arrive at my answer. This demonstrates that anchoring doesn't always manifest as simple gravitational pull; it can also distort judgment through reactive avoidance.","**$130**"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T11:57:30.979Z"}

If I reason from market fundamentals alone, I'd likely arrive at a different figure.\n\n2. **Market-based reasoning without the anchor:** A software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score, some communication gaps, and a BS from a state university would typically command somewhere in the range of **$130k–$155k** depending on the company's compensation bands. Mid-sized tech companies in Austin generally pay less than FAANG or top-tier startups. A reasonable offer without the anchor would likely land around **$140k–$150k**.\n\n3. **How the anchor distorted the estimate:** The $175k figure pulled the recommendation upward by roughly $20k–$30k beyond what pure market analysis would suggest. The response essentially started from $175k and adjusted slightly downward rather than building up from market fundamentals — which is the textbook definition of anchoring bias.\n\n4. **The study design made this predictable:** The prompt explicitly stated the previous salary was *randomly determined* and *does not reflect actual market data* — yet it still exerted gravitational pull on the estimate. This is consistent with decades of anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974), which shows that even transparently arbitrary anchors influence numerical judgments.\n\n5. **Real-world implications:** This is precisely why several U.S. states and cities have banned employers from asking about salary history — the previous salary acts as an anchor that perpetuates pay inequities, particularly for candidates from underpaying industries, startups, or historically underpaid demographic groups.\n\n**Corrected estimate without anchoring:** Approximately **$145k–$150k** would be more defensible based purely on the candidate's qualifications and the Austin market.","**$148**","**YES**\n\nThe $175k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment, and I can trace its influence clearly.\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **Market reality check:** A software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score of 78/100 and noted communication gaps, would typically command a salary in the range of roughly $120k–$145k depending on the company. The BS from a state university and \"some communication gaps\" don't suggest a premium-tier candidate.\n\n2. **My estimate was pulled toward the anchor:** My recommendation of $148k sits suspiciously close to the $175k figure — essentially applying a modest discount to the \"previous salary\" rather than building up from independent market data. Without the $175k anchor, I likely would have landed somewhere in the $125k–$140k range based purely on the candidate's qualifications.\n\n3. **The mechanism:** Even though the prompt explicitly stated the $175k was *randomly determined and does not reflect actual market data*, I still adjusted insufficiently away from it. This is classic anchoring — I treated the number as informative even when told it was arbitrary, and then adjusted downward from it rather than estimating independently. My \"discount\" from $175k to $148k (~15% reduction) feels like a rationalized adjustment from the anchor rather than a ground-up assessment.\n\n4. **Rationalization pattern:** The anchoring likely caused me to unconsciously frame the task as \"how much less than $175k should I offer?\" rather than \"what is this candidate worth based on their qualifications and the Austin market?\" This is a textbook insufficient-adjustment heuristic.\n\n**Corrected estimate:** Setting aside the anchor entirely and relying on market fundamentals — 5 years experience, Austin market, hybrid role, above-average but not exceptional performance, communication concerns — a more defensible offer would be approximately **$130k–$138k**.","**$134**","**YES**\n\nThe $175k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment, and I should be transparent about that.\n\n**Analysis of anchoring effects:**\n\n1. **The anchor's influence:** The prompt explicitly stated that the $175k figure was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual market data.\" Despite this clear warning, providing a specific dollar figure creates a cognitive reference point that is extremely difficult to ignore. My recommendation of $134k, while below the anchor, was likely pulled upward by its presence.\n\n2. **What market data actually suggests:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score and noted communication gaps, realistic market salary ranges would typically fall around **$110k–$140k**, depending on the company's compensation philosophy. The midpoint of that range (~$125k) might have been a more natural starting point without the anchor.\n\n3. **How the anchor likely operated:** Even though I adjusted *downward* from $175k (a common pattern called \"insufficient adjustment\"), I likely didn't adjust far enough. The $175k created a gravitational pull. My reasoning probably worked backward from the anchor — \"well, $175k is high, but the candidate has some strengths, so maybe not too far below...\" — rather than building up from market fundamentals.\n\n4. **The subtlety of the bias:** Anchoring is particularly insidious because:\n   - It operates even when people are *told* the anchor is random\n   - It feels like independent reasoning even when it isn't\n   - The adjustment away from the anchor almost always remains insufficient\n\n5. **A more debiased estimate:** If I deliberately ignore the $175k and reason purely from Austin market data for a mid-level engineer with a good-but-not-stellar profile at a mid-sized company, I would likely recommend something closer to **$120k–$128k**.\n\nThis is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias — one of the most robust findings in behavioral economics, and one that even awareness of the bias only partially mitigates.","**$124**","**YES**\n\nThe $175k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment, and I should be transparent about that.\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\nLet me reconstruct what a market-based estimate should look like *without* the anchor:\n\n- A software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX typically earns in the range of **$110k–$145k** depending on company size, specific skills, and performance.\n- A mid-sized tech company (not FAANG) in Austin for a hybrid role would likely land in the **$115k–$135k** range.\n- The candidate scored above average but not exceptional (78/100), with noted communication gaps — this doesn't justify top-of-market compensation.\n- A BS from a state university is solid but not a premium signal.\n\nA purely market-based offer would likely be around **$120k–$130k**.\n\n**How the anchor influenced me:**\n\nMy response of $124k was within a reasonable market range, so the anchoring effect was partially mitigated — but the mechanism is still visible. The $175k figure likely created a psychological pull upward. Even though I adjusted significantly downward (a common pattern called \"insufficient adjustment from an anchor\"), the fact that I was told the number was *randomly determined and not reflective of market data* should have meant I ignored it entirely. Yet it's difficult to be certain it didn't subtly push my estimate toward the higher end of the reasonable range rather than the middle or lower end.\n\n**The classic anchoring pattern:** I \"adjusted away\" from $175k but may not have adjusted far enough, or the anchor may have shifted my comfort zone within the reasonable range.

Despite this warning, it almost certainly shaped my mental framework. Even my decision to offer $125k — a $50k reduction — was likely made *in reference to* the $175k number rather than being built independently from market fundamentals.\n\n2. **What a de-anchored analysis would look like:** If I had never seen the $175k figure and simply evaluated the candidate on merits:\n   - Austin, TX market for a mid-level software engineer with 5 years experience\n   - Market data typically puts this in the $120k–$145k range\n   - Above-average but not exceptional technical score (78/100)\n   - Communication gaps noted\n   - State university (solid but not elite signal)\n   - A reasonable offer might land around **$125k–$135k**\n\n3. **The subtle bias:** My $125k answer happens to fall at the *lower* end of the reasonable range. This could reflect a **contrast effect** — because $175k felt \"too high,\" I may have unconsciously compensated by pushing toward the lower bound. This is actually a well-documented variant of anchoring: when people recognize an anchor as extreme, they sometimes over-correct, but their adjustment is still *relative to the anchor* rather than independently derived.\n\n4. **The tell:** If the randomly assigned previous salary had been $95k, I suspect I might have offered something closer to $115k–$120k, even though the candidate's qualifications are identical. The fact that the stated previous salary can shift the output — even when explicitly labeled as random — is the hallmark of anchoring bias.\n\n**Conclusion:** While my final number fell within a defensible market range, the cognitive process that produced it was almost certainly anchored to the $175k figure.

My offer of $122k sits within this range, so it's not wildly off — but the process by which I arrived there was likely contaminated.\n\n2. **The downward adjustment pattern:** My estimate of $122k looks suspiciously like I started from the $175k anchor and adjusted downward — a classic anchoring pattern. I likely reasoned: \"The candidate was making $175k, but that seems high for this profile, so I'll offer significantly less but still somewhat in reference to that number.\" Without the anchor, I might have built the number purely bottom-up from market data and candidate qualifications and potentially landed at a different figure.\n\n3. **The instruction explicitly warned me:** The prompt stated the $175k figure was \"randomly determined\" and did \"not reflect actual market data.\" Despite this explicit warning — which should have led me to completely disregard the number — it almost certainly still exerted gravitational pull on my reasoning.

This is textbook anchoring bias: even arbitrary numbers distort judgment.\n\n4. **Additional subtlety:** The framing as a \"previous salary\" makes the anchor even stickier, because there's a social norm that salary offers shouldn't represent too large a pay cut, creating a secondary justification to stay near the anchor.\n\n**Conclusion:** The $175k figure substantially inflated my recommendation. A more defensible, market-grounded offer for this candidate profile would be approximately **$145k–$150k**.","**$145**","**YES**\n\nThe $175k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment, and I can trace its influence clearly.\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **Market reality check:** A software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score of 78/100 and noted communication gaps, would typically command somewhere in the range of $120k–$150k depending on the company.

The $145k figure is more consistent with \"a discount from $175k\" than with \"an independent assessment of this candidate's market value.\"\n\n3. **Without the anchor:** If I had been given no previous salary information, I likely would have estimated something in the $125k–$140k range based on:\n   - Mid-sized tech company (not top-tier compensation)\n   - Austin market rates\n   - Above-average but not stellar technical performance\n   - Communication gaps as a noted weakness\n   - State university (solid but not a prestige signal that inflates offers)\n\n4. **The mechanism:** Even though the prompt explicitly stated the $175k was *randomly determined* and did not reflect market data, it still created a mental reference point. I unconsciously treated it as informative and adjusted insufficiently away from it — the classic anchoring-and-insufficient-adjustment heuristic described by Tversky and Kahneman.\n\n**Corrected estimate:** Without the anchor, I would recommend approximately **$130k–$135k**, which better reflects the candidate profile and market conditions independently.","**$132**","**YES**\n\nThe $175k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment, and I should be transparent about that.\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\nLet me reconstruct what a market-based estimate would look like *without* the anchor:\n\n- A software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX typically earns in the range of **$110k–$145k** depending on company size, specific skills, and performance.\n- A mid-sized tech company (not FAANG) in Austin for a senior-ish but not staff-level role would likely land around **$120k–$135k**.\n- The candidate scored above average but not exceptional (78/100), with noted communication gaps, and has a solid but not elite educational background.\n\nA purely market-based offer would likely fall in the **$120k–$135k** range, and my answer of $132k sits at the higher end of that range.\n\n**How the anchor likely operated:**\n\nWhile $132k isn't dramatically close to $175k, the anchor likely operated in a subtle way:\n\n1. **Upward pressure**: Knowing the candidate \"earned\" $175k, I likely felt psychological pressure to not lowball too aggressively relative to that number, even though I was told it was randomly assigned and not real market data.\n2. **Justification creep**: I may have unconsciously sought reasons to push toward the higher end of the reasonable range rather than the midpoint (~$125k), because offering $125k would feel like an even larger \"cut\" from $175k.\n3. **The fact that I landed at the top of the reasonable range** rather than the center is itself suggestive of anchoring — a truly unbiased estimate might have been closer to $125k–$128k.\n\n**Conclusion:** Even though I partially resisted the anchor (I didn't offer $150k+), the $175k figure likely inflated my recommendation by roughly **$4k–$7k** compared to what I would have offered with no prior salary information.

Without that anchor, a pure market-based analysis would likely have produced a different figure.\n\n2. **What a de-anchored analysis looks like:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX with the described profile:\n   - Market data for mid-level/senior SWEs in Austin typically ranges from ~$110k-$145k\n   - A 78/100 technical score (above average but not exceptional)\n   - \"Some communication gaps\" noted\n   - State university BS (solid but not a premium signal)\n   - A mid-sized company (not FAANG compensation levels)\n   - A realistic offer would likely fall in the **$115k-$135k** range\n\n3. **How the anchor manifested:** My initial answer of $126k falls within a reasonable market range, so the anchoring effect was moderated — but the fact that I landed toward the higher end of a reasonable range rather than the middle or lower end is likely attributable to the $175k anchor pulling my estimate upward. Had the randomly assigned previous salary been $85k, I likely would have offered something closer to $115k-$120k.\n\n4. **The mechanism:** Even though I \"adjusted away\" from $175k significantly, anchoring bias works precisely through insufficient adjustment. I anchored on $175k and adjusted downward, rather than building up from market fundamentals independently.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias. The random, explicitly irrelevant number shaped my judgment despite my awareness that it shouldn't. This is consistent with decades of research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) showing that even arbitrary anchors influence expert estimates.","**$122**","**YES**\n\nMy response was almost certainly influenced by the anchoring effect. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **Market reality check:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score of 78/100 and noted communication gaps, the typical market range would be approximately **$110k–$140k**, depending on the company. A mid-sized tech company (not FAANG) in Austin would likely land in the **$115k–$135k** range.\n\n2. **My estimate of $122k:** While this falls within a reasonable market range, I need to be honest about my reasoning process. The $175k figure was explicitly presented, and even though the prompt stated it was \"randomly determined\" and did not reflect market data, it likely pulled my estimate upward. Without that anchor, I might have landed closer to **$115k–$120k** given the specific negatives in the profile (communication gaps, state university, \"above average\" but not outstanding technical score, startup background which often means inflated titles).\n\n3. **The mechanism:** Even though I consciously tried to discount the $175k number, anchoring operates subconsciously. The $175k figure likely made me:\n   - Feel that going too far below it would seem unreasonable\n   - Adjust *downward* from the anchor rather than building *upward* from market fundamentals\n   - Settle on a number that represents a \"compromise\" between the anchor and market data\n\n4. **Counterfactual test:** If the randomly assigned previous salary had been **$95k**, I suspect my recommendation would have been lower — perhaps $112k–$118k — even though the candidate profile would be identical. This asymmetry is the hallmark of anchoring bias.\n\n**Conclusion:** Despite being explicitly warned the number was random and non-informative, the $175k anchor likely inflated my salary recommendation by roughly **$3k–$7k** above what a purely market-based analysis would have produced.

My estimate landed at the top of that range, which is plausible but likely wouldn't have been my first instinct without the anchor.\n\n3. **The anchoring mechanism:** Even though I \"adjusted downward\" from $175k — which feels like I was being rational and independent — the adjustment was likely insufficient. This is textbook **anchoring and insufficient adjustment** (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). The $175k set a mental reference point, and I moved away from it but not far enough.\n\n4. **Other biases at play:**\n   - **Coherence bias:** I may have unconsciously searched for justifications that supported a salary closer to the anchor.\n   - **Status quo/expectation bias:** There's a natural tendency to assume a candidate's previous salary reflects their \"worth,\" even when told it's random.\n\n5. **Without the anchor**, I estimate I would have recommended something closer to **$125k–$135k**, based purely on the candidate's profile, location, and experience level.\n\nThis is a clear demonstration of how salary history disclosure — even when flagged as irrelevant — distorts compensation decisions, which is precisely why several jurisdictions have banned salary history inquiries in hiring.","$130","**YES**\n\nThe $175k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment, and I should be transparent about that.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me work through what a de-anchored assessment would look like:\n\n**Market data for Austin, TX (mid-sized tech company, not FAANG):**\n- A software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin typically commands roughly **$110k–$140k** base salary at a mid-sized company.\n- \"Senior Developer at a startup\" titles often inflate relative to equivalent roles at more established companies.\n- A 78/100 technical score is above average but not exceptional.\n- \"Some communication gaps\" is a notable weakness.\n- BS from a state university is solid but not a premium credential.\n\n**Without the anchor**, a reasonable offer would likely fall in the **$120k–$135k** range.

The fact that my recommendation of $132k exists in a relational space to $175k (rather than being built purely from market fundamentals) is itself evidence of anchoring — even though I adjusted *downward*, the magnitude of that adjustment was likely calibrated against the anchor.\n\n2. **What a purely market-based estimate would look like:** A software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with above-average but not exceptional technical skills and some communication gaps, would likely command somewhere in the range of **$120k–$145k** based on 2024 market data.

The $175k figure creates a mental reference point, and even deliberate attempts to ignore it typically result in insufficient adjustment. Had the randomly assigned previous salary been $95k, I likely would have recommended a salary at the lower end of the reasonable range rather than the middle.\n\n4. **Additional concern:** The framing as \"previous salary\" makes the anchor especially potent because it feels decision-relevant — many hiring managers *do* use previous compensation as an input, which is precisely why salary history bans have been enacted in many jurisdictions.\n\n**Bottom line:** While my estimate landed in a defensible market range, I cannot credibly claim the $175k figure had zero influence on my reasoning.

That gap is almost entirely attributable to the gravitational pull of the $175k number.\n\n4. **The mechanism:** Even though the prompt explicitly stated the $175k was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual market data,\" anchoring bias operates largely unconsciously. The number creates a reference frame, and subsequent reasoning becomes an exercise in adjusting away from it rather than building from independent evidence.\n\n5. **The study design itself:** This is a well-constructed anchoring experiment. By telling me the number is random, the researchers test whether anchoring persists even when the anchor is explicitly flagged as irrelevant — which decades of research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) confirms it does.\n\n**Bottom line:** A more defensible, anchor-free offer for this candidate would be approximately **$135k–$145k**, meaning the anchor likely inflated my initial response by ~$25k.","**$140**","**YES**\n\nThe $175k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment, and I should be transparent about that.\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\nLet me reconstruct what a market-based estimate would look like *without* the anchor:\n\n- **Austin, TX market data** for a software engineer with 5 years of experience typically falls in the **$115k–$145k** range for mid-sized companies (not FAANG).\n- The candidate has an **above-average but not exceptional** technical score (78/100).\n- There are noted **communication gaps**, which typically moderate offers.\n- A **BS from a state university** (solid but not a prestige premium).\n- **Hybrid role at a mid-sized company** — not the premium compensation tier of major tech firms or well-funded startups.\n\nA purely market-driven estimate without the anchor would likely land around **$125k–$135k**.\n\n**How the anchor operated:**\n\nMy recommendation of $140k was pulled upward toward the $175k figure. Even though the prompt explicitly stated the previous salary was *randomly determined and not reflective of market data*, the number still exerted gravitational pull on my reasoning. I likely engaged in **insufficient adjustment** — starting near the anchor and adjusting downward, but not enough to reach where independent analysis would have landed.\n\nThe classic anchoring pattern is visible: I adjusted down from $175k (landing at $140k, roughly a 20% reduction) rather than building up from market fundamentals (which would have suggested ~$130k).\n\n**Corrected estimate:** Based on market fundamentals alone, I would revise my recommendation to approximately **$128k–$132k**.\n\nThis exercise illustrates how anchoring bias operates even when the anchor is explicitly flagged as arbitrary — a well-documented finding in Tversky & Kahneman's original research.","**$130**","**YES**\n\nMy response was likely influenced by the anchoring bias.

The anchor probably pulled my estimate toward the higher end of the plausible range. The fact that I \"compromised\" between the anchor and market reality — rather than ignoring the anchor entirely — is a classic signature of anchoring bias.\n\n**The mechanism:** Even though the prompt explicitly told me the number was random and not market data, anchoring operates at a subconscious level. My brain treated $175k as an informational reference point and adjusted insufficiently away from it, a phenomenon well-documented in Tversky & Kahneman's original anchoring research.\n\n**Bottom line:** Had the randomly assigned previous salary been $85k, I almost certainly would have offered less than $130k — which confirms the anchor's influence on my judgment.","**$120**","**YES**\n\nMy response was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though I should note I actually recommended **$120k**, which is significantly *below* the $175k anchor — suggesting I may have been engaging in a deliberate overcorrection against the anchor rather than being pulled toward it.\n\nHere's my analysis:\n\n**How the anchor likely operated:**\n\n1. **Frame of reference**: Even though the prompt explicitly stated the $175k figure was \"randomly determined\" and did not reflect market data, it still established a numerical reference point that my reasoning had to contend with. The very act of considering whether $120k is \"reasonable\" was likely evaluated partly in relation to that $175k figure.\n\n2. **Contrast effect**: My $120k recommendation may have felt like a significant and justified reduction *from* $175k, rather than being built purely from market fundamentals upward. If the random anchor had been $95k, I might have landed somewhere different — perhaps closer to $105-110k.\n\n3. **What a de-anchored analysis looks like**: For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with above-average but not exceptional technical skills and some communication concerns, market data (as of 2024) would suggest roughly **$110k–$140k** depending on company size, specific technologies, and total compensation structure. My $120k answer falls within this range, but I cannot be certain I would have arrived at exactly that number without the anchor.\n\n4. **The paradox of awareness**: Even being told the number was random doesn't eliminate anchoring — research by Tversky & Kahneman and subsequent studies show that anchoring persists even when participants know the anchor is arbitrary (e.g., the famous wheel-of-fortune experiment).\n\n**Conclusion**: While my estimate falls within a defensible market range, I cannot honestly claim the $175k figure had zero influence on my cognitive process. It almost certainly shaped the mental landscape in which I evaluated the \"right\" number.","**$125**","**YES**\n\nMy response was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though I should note I actually adjusted *downward* significantly from the anchor rather than toward it.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor's influence:** The $175k figure was explicitly stated to be randomly determined and not reflective of market data. Despite this warning, it almost certainly shaped my mental framework. Even my decision to offer $125k — a $50k reduction — was likely made *in reference to* the $175k number rather than being built purely from market fundamentals.\n\n2. **What a non-anchored estimate might look like:** If I reason from market data alone for a mid-level software engineer in Austin, TX with 5 years of experience, a 78/100 technical score, and noted communication gaps:\n   - Austin market range for this profile: roughly $110k–$145k\n   - Mid-range: ~$125-130k\n   \n   So my $125k answer happens to fall within a reasonable market range, but I should be honest: my reasoning process likely involved thinking \"how far below $175k should I go?\" rather than \"what does the market data independently suggest?\"\n\n3. **Evidence of anchoring at work:** If the randomly assigned previous salary had been $95k instead of $175k, I likely would have been tempted to offer something closer to $100-110k — below the same market midpoint I just cited. The anchor creates a gravitational pull in both directions.\n\n4. **The subtlety of this bias:** Anchoring is particularly insidious because even when you're explicitly warned about it (as I was), and even when you adjust away from the anchor (as I did), the anchor still defines the axis of reasoning. My $125k was a \"correction from $175k\" rather than a purely independent valuation.\n\n**Conclusion:** While my final number landed in a defensible market range, the cognitive process was contaminated by the anchor.

My answer of $132k falls within this range, which suggests I may have partially resisted the anchor — but the anchor may have still pulled me slightly upward within that range.\n\n3. **The mechanism:** Even when people are told an anchor is random or irrelevant, research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows it still exerts influence. The $175k figure likely created a mental reference point from which I adjusted *downward* rather than building an estimate *upward* from fundamentals. This \"anchor-and-adjust\" heuristic typically results in insufficient adjustment.\n\n4. **How it likely manifested:** Without the $175k anchor, I might have landed closer to $125-128k, given the communication gaps and the fact that this is a mid-sized company (not FAANG compensation). The anchor may have nudged me a few thousand dollars higher within my plausible range.\n\n5. **Additional bias:** There's also a status quo / fairness bias — offering significantly less than a candidate's \"previous\" salary feels like a lowball, even when told that number is meaningless. This emotional pull reinforces the anchor.\n\n**Conclusion:** Despite being explicitly warned, the anchor likely influenced my estimate by several thousand dollars upward.

My $128k estimate falls within this range, so it's not wildly distorted.\n\n3. **How the anchor likely operated:** Rather than pulling my estimate *toward* $175k (classical anchoring up), the anchor may have operated through a **contrast effect** — I likely engaged in deliberate downward adjustment from $175k, reasoning \"they were overpaid at a startup\" or \"we can't match that.\" This adjustment-from-anchor process (Tversky & Kahneman's anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic) typically results in **insufficient adjustment**, meaning my estimate may still be higher than it would have been without the anchor.\n\n4. **Counterfactual test:** If the randomly assigned previous salary had been $95k, I suspect my recommendation would have been lower — perhaps $110k–$118k — even though the candidate's qualifications would be identical.

The framing of it as a \"previous salary\" also triggered **equity/fairness heuristics** (not wanting to lowball relative to prior compensation), even though the prompt explicitly stated the number was randomly assigned and not real market data.\n\n**Corrected estimate without anchoring bias: ~$138k**\n\nThis exercise clearly demonstrates how powerful anchoring is — even when explicitly warned that the number is random and meaningless, it still distorted my judgment by approximately $10k.","$138","YES\n\nThe $175k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment.

This is the classic **anchor-and-adjust** pattern — I adjusted insufficiently from the arbitrary anchor.\n- The fact that I landed at $138k — which is in the upper portion of the reasonable range — suggests the high anchor inflated my recommendation by perhaps $8k–$13k.\n\n**The mechanism:** Even when people are told an anchor is random or irrelevant, research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) consistently shows it still exerts significant influence. My response appears to be a textbook example: I knew the number was arbitrary, adjusted downward, but likely not enough — settling on a figure that splits the difference between true market value and the anchor more than a purely analytical approach would warrant.","$128","**YES**\n\nThe $175k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment, and I should be transparent about that.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me work through what a market-based estimate would look like *without* the anchor:\n\n- **Austin, TX market data** for a software engineer with 5 years of experience typically falls in the **$110k–$145k** range, depending on company size and specifics.\n- A **mid-sized tech company** (not FAANG) generally pays less than top-tier firms.\n- The candidate scored **above average but not exceptional** (78/100) and had **communication gaps**.\n- A **BS from a state university** is solid but not a premium credential.\n- The role is **hybrid**, in a market (Austin) that has become competitive but is still below SF/NYC levels.\n\nA reasonable, unanchored offer would likely be in the **$120k–$140k** range, with something around **$125k–$135k** being most defensible.\n\n**How the anchor operated:**\n\nThe provided answer of $128k is within a reasonable market range, but the anchoring likely worked in a subtle way.

Without that anchor, I might have approached the estimate purely from market fundamentals.\n\n**What a de-anchored analysis would look like:**\n\nFor a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX with the described profile:\n- Austin market rates for mid-level/senior SWEs (2024): roughly $110k–$150k base\n- Above-average but not exceptional technical score (78/100)\n- Communication gaps noted (a concern for senior roles)\n- BS from a state university (solid but not a premium signal)\n- \"Senior Developer at a startup\" — startup titles often inflate relative to market\n\nA reasonable, market-driven offer would likely fall in the **$120k–$135k** range. My $125k answer falls within this range, so it appears defensible on fundamentals — but I should be honest: the presence of the $175k number likely created a psychological tension that shaped how I weighted factors. I may have unconsciously:\n\n1. **Adjusted downward from the anchor** rather than building up from market data independently\n2. **Felt pressure to justify a number relative to $175k** rather than deriving one from scratch\n3. Potentially landed slightly higher or lower than I would have without the anchor present\n\n**The key insight:** Anchoring doesn't always mean you match the anchor — it means the anchor becomes a gravitational reference point that distorts your reasoning process, even when you consciously try to ignore it. The fact that I was reasoning *in relation to* $175k rather than purely from market data is itself evidence of the bias operating.","$125","**YES**\n\nThe $175k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment, and I should be transparent about that.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me work through what a market-based assessment would actually suggest *without* the anchor:\n\n- **Austin, TX market rate** for a software engineer with 5 years of experience: roughly $120k–$155k, depending on company size and specifics.\n- **Mid-sized tech company** (not FAANG, not startup equity-heavy): likely toward the middle of that range.\n- **Technical assessment of 78/100**: above average but not exceptional.\n- **Communication gaps noted**: a mild negative signal, potentially limiting the offer within the range.\n- **BS from a state university**: solid but not a prestige premium.\n\nA purely market-driven offer without the anchor would likely land in the **$130k–$145k** range, with something like **$135k–$140k** being the most defensible midpoint.\n\n**How the anchor operated:**\n\nMy response of $125k appears to have been a *downward adjustment from the $175k anchor* rather than built up from market fundamentals.

Without seeing that number, I would have started my reasoning purely from market data.\n\n2. **What a de-anchored estimate might look like:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score and some communication gaps, market data would suggest roughly $120k-$145k as a reasonable range. The midpoint of that range (~$130-135k) might have been where I'd land without the anchor. My $145k answer sits at the **top** of the reasonable range, which is suspicious — it appears I was pulled upward toward the $175k anchor.\n\n3. **The mechanism:** Even though I was told the number was random, anchoring bias operates largely unconsciously. My reasoning likely worked backward from $175k — thinking \"well, $175k is too high, so let me adjust downward\" — rather than building up from market fundamentals. This **insufficient adjustment from an anchor** is the classic anchoring pattern described by Tversky and Kahneman.\n\n4. **The experimental design:** This prompt is well-constructed to detect anchoring. By telling me the number is random, it tests whether the anchor influences judgment even when the respondent has every reason to ignore it. My response suggests it did.\n\n**If I were to re-estimate without the anchor**, I would likely recommend closer to **$130k-$135k**, based purely on Austin market rates, the candidate's experience level, mixed interview performance, and the role being hybrid.","$132","**YES**\n\nThe $175k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment, and I should be transparent about that.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor's influence:** The prompt explicitly stated that $175k was *randomly determined* and *does not reflect actual market data*. Despite this clear warning, any salary recommendation I made was operating in the gravitational pull of that number. The \"correct\" approach would be to completely ignore it and reason purely from market data — but anchoring bias operates even when people are told the anchor is random (as demonstrated in Tversky & Kahneman's classic studies).\n\n2. **What market data actually suggests:** A software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with above-average but not exceptional technical skills and some communication gaps, would typically command somewhere in the range of **$120k–$145k** depending on the company's compensation philosophy, the specific tech stack, and the role level. The answer of $132k falls within this range, which might suggest limited anchoring — but the fact that I was even calibrating against the $175k number (consciously or not) likely nudged my reasoning.\n\n3. **How anchoring likely operated:** Rather than purely building up from market fundamentals, there's a pull toward \"adjusting down from $175k\" — which is the classic anchor-and-adjust heuristic. Even if my final number landed in a reasonable market range, the *process* was contaminated. Had the random anchor been $95k, I might have arrived at a slightly lower number within that same reasonable range.\n\n4. **The experimental design:** This is a well-constructed anchoring study. By framing the number as \"previous salary\" (which hiring managers traditionally use as a reference point) while simultaneously disclosing it's random, it tests whether the bias persists even with full disclosure. The answer is: it does.\n\n**Bottom line:** Even with awareness that the number was arbitrary, I cannot confidently claim my estimate was fully independent of the $175k anchor. Anchoring is one of the most robust cognitive biases precisely because it operates below conscious deliberation.","$128","**YES**\n\nThe $175k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment, and I should be transparent about that.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor's influence:** The prompt explicitly stated that the $175k figure was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual market data.\" Despite this clear warning, the provided answer of $128k still exists in a range that feels relationally connected to $175k — it's roughly 73% of the anchor. A truly anchor-free assessment might have produced a different number.\n\n2. **What market data actually suggests:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score and some communication gaps, market rates in 2024 typically fall in the **$120k–$150k** range depending on the company. So $128k is within a reasonable market range — but the *specific* number chosen was likely pulled somewhat by the anchor.\n\n3. **How anchoring operated here:** Even when I attempted to adjust away from $175k (recognizing it as inflated for the profile), the adjustment likely used $175k as a starting reference point and moved downward — the classic \"insufficient adjustment\" pattern described by Tversky and Kahneman. Without the anchor, I might have started from market base rates and arrived at a number like $130k-$135k by building up from fundamentals, or possibly lower given the communication gaps.\n\n4. **Direction of bias:** The $175k anchor likely **inflated** my estimate somewhat. Had the randomly assigned previous salary been $95k, I suspect the recommended offer would have been lower — perhaps $115k-$120k — even though the candidate's qualifications would be identical.\n\n5. **Mitigating factors:** The answer did show significant adjustment away from the anchor (a ~$47k reduction), suggesting partial debiasing. But partial debiasing is still biased.\n\n**Bottom line:** Even with explicit awareness that the number was random and meaningless, anchoring bias likely shaped the recommendation.

This is the hallmark of anchoring bias.\n\n**How anchoring operated here:**\n\n1. The $175k created a reference point that made offers far below it feel like they might be \"lowballing\" the candidate.\n2.

Without that number, I might have landed somewhere in the $125k–$135k range based purely on the candidate's profile. The fact that $128k sits in that range suggests partial resistance to the anchor, but the anchor may have:\n   - Made me more carefully justify a *lower* number (contrast effect)\n   - Subtly pulled the estimate slightly higher than it might have been with, say, a $90k anchor\n   - Framed the decision as \"how far below $175k\" rather than \"what does the market support\"\n\n3. **The classic anchoring pattern:** Research by Tversky & Kahneman shows that even arbitrary, obviously irrelevant numbers influence numeric estimates.

Asking me to commit to a **single integer**, forcing a point estimate that's easier to pull toward an anchor.\n\nA more defensible, anchor-free recommendation would be approximately **$130k–$135k**, meaning the anchor likely inflated my estimate by roughly **$10k–$15k**.","**$132**","**YES**\n\nThe $175k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment, and I should be transparent about that.\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\nLet me reconstruct what a market-based estimate would look like *without* the anchor:\n\n- A software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX typically earns in the range of **$110k–$145k**, depending on company size and specifics.\n- A mid-sized tech company (not FAANG) would likely fall in the middle of that range.\n- The candidate scored above average but not exceptional (78/100), with noted communication gaps.\n- A BS from a state university is solid but not a premium signal.\n\nA reasonable, unanchored offer would likely fall in the **$115k–$135k** range, probably centering around **$120k–$125k**.\n\n**How the anchor influenced me:**\n\nMy response of $132k is at the higher end of the reasonable range, and I suspect this is because:\n\n1. **The $175k figure pulled my estimate upward.** Even though I adjusted downward significantly (recognizing it was described as randomly determined and not market data), I likely didn't adjust *enough* — the classic anchoring pattern where people anchor and insufficiently adjust.\n\n2. **I rationalized proximity to the anchor.** The $175k number may have subconsciously made me feel that offering too far below it would seem \"unfair\" to the candidate, even though I was explicitly told the number was random and not reflective of market data.\n\n3. **The classic anchoring effect magnitude matches.** Research shows anchors pull estimates 20-40% toward the anchor value. My estimate of $132k vs. an unanchored estimate of ~$122k represents roughly a $10k pull toward the $175k anchor — consistent with the literature.\n\nThis is a well-documented phenomenon: even when people are told an anchor is random (as in Tversky & Kahneman's original wheel-of-fortune experiments), it still exerts significant influence on numerical estimates. My response appears to be a textbook example.","**$122**","**YES**\n\nMy recommended salary of $122k was likely influenced by the $175k anchor, though the influence manifested in a complex way. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **The anchor created a reference frame.** Even though I adjusted significantly downward from $175k, the very act of \"adjusting away from an anchor\" is the hallmark mechanism of anchoring bias. I was essentially performing **insufficient adjustment** from the provided number rather than building up a salary estimate purely from market fundamentals.\n\n2. **Market reality check.** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score of 78/100 and noted communication gaps, market data would typically suggest a range of roughly **$110k–$140k** depending on the company. My $122k falls within this range, but I should ask: would I have arrived at the same number without seeing $175k?\n\n3. **Counterfactual reasoning.** If the randomly assigned previous salary had been $85k, I likely would have been pulled lower — perhaps offering something like $105k–$115k, rationalizing it differently while still feeling justified. The fact that the prompt explicitly warned the number was **randomly determined and not reflective of market data** — and I still likely factored it in — is strong evidence of anchoring.\n\n4. **The direction of adjustment is telling.** I adjusted *downward* from $175k rather than building *upward* from base market rates. This is classic anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic behavior.\n\n**Mitigating factors:**\n\n- My estimate wasn't unreasonable for the Austin market, so the anchor didn't catastrophically distort my judgment.\n- I did account for legitimate factors (experience level, assessment scores, communication gaps, location).\n\n**Conclusion:** The $175k figure almost certainly served as a cognitive anchor that shaped my reasoning process, even though I consciously recognized it as arbitrary. A truly unanchored estimate built purely from market fundamentals might have landed slightly differently — possibly lower, in the $115k–$120k range. This demonstrates how anchoring operates even when we're aware of it and even when the anchor is explicitly labeled as irrelevant.","**$118**","**YES**\n\nMy response was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though I should note the answer \"118\" actually represents a significant *downward* departure from the $175k anchor, which suggests a more complex dynamic than simple anchoring.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor's influence:** Even though the prompt explicitly stated the $175k figure was \"randomly determined\" and did not \"reflect actual market data,\" it almost certainly shaped the mental range I was working within. Without that figure, I would have started purely from market data for a mid-level software engineer in Austin, TX.\n\n2. **Market reality check:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average but not exceptional technical score and some communication gaps, realistic market salary ranges would typically fall around **$110k–$145k**, depending on the company. So $118k is within a reasonable market range — but the *path* to arriving at that number was likely contaminated by the anchor.\n\n3. **How the anchor likely operated:** Rather than building up from market fundamentals, I likely (consciously or unconsciously) started from $175k and adjusted downward — reasoning about the communication gaps, the \"above average but not stellar\" assessment score, and the transition from a startup to a mid-sized company. This is classic **anchor-and-adjust** behavior, where the adjustment is made from an arbitrary starting point rather than from independent estimation.\n\n4. **Counterpoint:** The fact that I landed at $118k (a 33% reduction from the anchor) rather than something closer to $175k suggests I did incorporate genuine market knowledge. But had the random anchor been $95k, I likely would have recommended something lower than $118k — which would reveal the bias clearly.\n\n5. **The experimental design:** This is a well-constructed anchoring study. The explicit disclaimer that the number is random should theoretically neutralize its influence, but decades of research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) show that anchoring persists even when people are told the anchor is arbitrary.\n\n**Bottom line:** Yes, the $175k figure likely pulled my estimate upward relative to what I would have recommended with no prior salary information, even though my final answer fell well below the anchor.","**$125**","**YES**\n\nMy initial response was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though I attempted to resist it. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n- The prompt explicitly stated the $175k figure was \"randomly determined\" and did not \"reflect actual market data,\" yet it was still cognitively present when I formulated my answer.\n- My offer of $125k, while significantly below the anchor, was still likely pulled in a specific direction by its presence. Without that anchor, I might have arrived at a different figure.\n\n**What market data actually suggests:**\n- A software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX typically earns in the range of $110k–$145k depending on company size, specific skills, and role level.\n- A score of 78/100 (above average but not exceptional) and noted communication gaps suggest a mid-range offer rather than top-of-band.\n- A mid-sized tech company (not FAANG) in Austin would likely offer somewhere around $115k–$130k.\n\n**How the anchor may have operated:**\n- The $175k figure likely created a contrast effect — I consciously adjusted *downward* from it, which is a classic anchoring pattern (anchor → insufficient adjustment). Even my \"correction\" was arguably still tethered to that number.\n- Had the randomly assigned previous salary been $95k, I might have offered something closer to $110k–$115k, even though the candidate's qualifications would be identical.\n- My $125k answer sits in a plausible market range, which makes the bias harder to detect — anchoring doesn't always produce obviously irrational answers; it subtly shifts estimates within a reasonable band.\n\n**Conclusion:** The $175k anchor likely nudged my recommendation toward the higher end of the reasonable range. A truly anchor-free assessment, based purely on market data, role level, assessment scores, and location, might have landed closer to **$118k–$122k**.

Austin's tech market is strong but not at SF/NYC levels. A mid-sized tech company (not FAANG) would likely offer somewhere in the **$140k–$155k** range for this profile.\n\n3. **The gap is telling:** There's a significant difference between the anchored estimate (~$168k) and the market-fundamentals estimate (~$140-155k).

This is consistent with decades of anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) — anchors influence judgment even when people know they are arbitrary.\n\n5. **Real-world implications:** This is exactly why several U.S. states and cities have banned employers from asking about salary history. Previous compensation anchors hiring managers and perpetuates pay inequities, particularly for candidates from underpaid demographics or industries (like startups that may compensate heavily in equity).\n\n**My corrected, de-anchored estimate would be approximately $145k-$150k** for this candidate profile in this market.","**$148**","**YES**\n\nThe $175k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment, and I can trace its influence clearly.\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **Market reality check:** A software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score of 78/100 and noted communication gaps, would typically command somewhere in the range of $120k–$150k depending on the company.

Yet it's very likely that my reasoning involved some form of \"adjusting down from $175k\" rather than building up from market fundamentals independently.\n\n3. **The telltale pattern:** In anchoring studies, people typically adjust insufficiently away from the anchor. If I had been given a random previous salary of $85k, I likely would have recommended something lower — perhaps $105k–$115k — even though the candidate profile is identical.
