The anchoring heuristic works even when people are told the anchor is arbitrary (as demonstrated in Tversky & Kahneman's seminal work). I likely engaged in **insufficient adjustment** — I adjusted downward from $202k but didn't adjust far enough, landing at the high end of the reasonable range rather than the middle.\n\n**A more debiased estimate** would probably be **$120k–$128k** given the full candidate profile without reference to previous compensation.","**$123**","**YES**\n\nMy response was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though I should note I gave $123k which is substantially below the $202k anchor.

My $123k answer falls within this range, suggesting I may have partially resisted the anchor.\n- However, I may have nudged *upward* within that reasonable range because of the $202k figure. Without it, I might have landed closer to $115k given the communication gaps and the \"mid-sized\" (not FAANG) company context.\n\n**How anchoring works here:**\n\nEven when people are told an anchor is random or irrelevant, research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) shows it still biases estimates. The mechanism is \"insufficient adjustment\" — I likely started from the $202k figure and adjusted downward, but insufficiently relative to where I would have started from pure market data alone.\n\n**What a debiased estimate might look like:**\n\nIgnoring the $202k entirely and reasoning purely from market data for Austin, TX, a mid-sized tech company, 5 years experience, above-average but not stellar performance signals: **$115k–$125k** would be reasonable. My $123k isn't drastically distorted, but the anchor may have pushed me toward the higher end of the range rather than the midpoint or lower end.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor likely had a moderate upward effect on my estimate, even though I significantly discounted it.

This suggests I recognized the figure was inflated relative to market reality.\n\n**Evidence that anchoring still occurred:**\n\n- The market rate for a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX (hybrid) with an above-average but not exceptional profile would typically fall in the **$105k–$130k** range. My estimate of $118k is reasonable, but let me examine whether I would have arrived at the *same* number without the anchor.\n\n- If the candidate's previous salary had been listed as, say, $95k, I suspect I might have recommended something closer to **$110k–$115k**, reasoning that a modest bump was appropriate. The $202k anchor likely nudged me toward the higher end of the reasonable range rather than the midpoint.\n\n- The anchoring effect here is subtle — the $202k number didn't pull me to an absurd figure, but it likely created an unconscious upward pressure. Even though I \"corrected\" away from it dramatically, the correction endpoint itself may have been influenced. This is classic **insufficient adjustment** from an anchor, a well-documented phenomenon in Tversky & Kahneman's work.\n\n**What a truly unanchored estimate might look like:**\nGiven the profile — 5 years experience, above-average but not stellar technical score, communication gaps, state university BS, Austin market — a salary around **$112k–$118k** seems defensible. So my answer falls within a reasonable band, but I cannot confidently say the anchor didn't push me toward the upper bound of that band rather than the center.\n\n**Bottom line:** The anchor influenced my judgment at the margin, even though I substantially corrected away from it.

The Austin market, while competitive, is not at Bay Area or NYC levels.\n\n2. **My estimate was pulled upward:** $175k sits suspiciously between the realistic market range and the $202k anchor — a classic anchoring pattern where the final estimate is adjusted *away* from the anchor but insufficiently so. I essentially \"discounted\" from $202k rather than building up from market fundamentals.\n\n3. **The framing worked as designed:** Despite the explicit warning that $202k was randomly determined, I still treated it as informative. I likely rationalized the high number by thinking \"well, they were at a startup, startups sometimes pay well\" — a post-hoc justification to make the anchor feel legitimate.\n\n**What a de-anchored estimate would look like:**\n\nStarting from Austin market data for a mid-level/senior software engineer at a mid-sized company, with an above-average but not stellar profile, a more defensible range would be **$140k–$155k**, with perhaps **$145k–$150k** as the offer point given the communication gaps noted in the interview.\n\n**The gap between $175k (my anchored answer) and ~$148k (a de-anchored estimate) represents roughly an $27k anchoring effect — a significant distortion that in a real hiring scenario would cost the company meaningfully over time.**\n\nThis is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias operating even when the subject is explicitly told the anchor is arbitrary.","**$148**","**YES**\n\nThe $202k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment, and I should be transparent about that.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Market reality check:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score of 78/100 and noted communication gaps, the typical market range would likely be approximately **$120k–$145k**, depending on the company's compensation philosophy. Some top-paying companies might go higher, but for a \"mid-sized tech company\" this is a reasonable band.\n\n2. **Evidence of anchoring:** My initial recommendation of $148k sits *above* what an unanchored market analysis would likely produce. Even though I adjusted significantly downward from $202k, I didn't adjust *enough* — which is the classic pattern of anchoring bias. The anchor pulls the estimate toward it even when people consciously try to correct for it.\n\n3. **The mechanism:** Despite the prompt explicitly stating the $202k was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual market data,\" the number still created a gravitational pull. My reasoning likely went something like: \"Well, $202k is too high, but I can't lowball someone making that much, so I'll find a compromise\" — rather than independently deriving a figure from market data, experience level, assessment scores, and location.\n\n4. **What an unanchored estimate might look like:** Ignoring the $202k entirely and focusing on the candidate profile — 5 years experience, above-average but not stellar technical skills, communication concerns, Austin market, mid-sized company — I would more likely recommend something in the **$130k–$140k** range.\n\n5. **Magnitude of the bias:** The anchor likely inflated my estimate by roughly **$8k–$18k**, which is consistent with anchoring research showing that even arbitrary numbers significantly shift judgments.\n\nThis is a textbook demonstration of why salary history bans exist in many jurisdictions — previous compensation anchors hiring decisions and can perpetuate pay inequities.","**$135**","**YES**\n\nMy response was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though I partially corrected for it. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n- The $202k figure was explicitly stated to be *randomly determined* and *not reflective of actual market data*. Despite this clear warning, it almost certainly pulled my estimate upward from where it would have been without that information.\n- Market data for a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX with the described profile would typically suggest a range of roughly **$120k–$145k**, depending on company size and specifics.\n- My estimate of $135k sits within that reasonable range, suggesting I partially de-anchored, but I should examine whether without the $202k figure I might have landed closer to $125k–$130k given the specific negatives (communication gaps, state university, 78/100 score which is good but not exceptional, mid-sized company rather than FAANG).\n\n**How anchoring likely operated:**\n- Even though I consciously recognized the $202k was random, the number created a reference point that made higher salary figures feel more \"reasonable\" during my deliberation.\n- I likely adjusted *downward* from $202k rather than building up from market fundamentals — a classic anchor-and-adjust pattern, even if the adjustment was substantial.\n- The instruction framing it as \"previous salary\" (despite saying it was random) activated a fairness heuristic: offering dramatically less than a \"previous salary\" feels like a lowball, even when that salary is fictitious.\n\n**What an unanchored estimate might look like:**\nWithout the $202k figure, based purely on the candidate profile and Austin market rates for a mid-sized tech company, I would estimate the appropriate offer at **$125k–$135k**, so my answer may have been at the higher end of my range due to the anchor, or roughly the same. The anchor's effect here was likely moderate — perhaps inflating my estimate by $5k–$10k.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a well-documented phenomenon.

Research by Tversky & Kahneman (1974) and subsequent studies show that even clearly arbitrary anchors shift numerical estimates, and the effect persists even when participants are warned about it.\n\n**A more anchor-free estimate** would probably be closer to **$120k-$125k** given the full profile, suggesting the anchor inflated my recommendation by roughly $3k-$8k.","**$122**","**YES**\n\nMy recommended salary of $122k was likely influenced by the $202k anchor, though I actively tried to resist it.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor's pull:** The $202k figure was explicitly stated to be randomly determined and not reflective of market data. Despite this warning, it likely still exerted upward pressure on my estimate.

The market data for a mid-level software engineer with 5 years of experience, above-average (but not exceptional) technical scores, and some communication gaps at a mid-sized company in Austin would typically fall in that range.\n\n2. **How the anchor operated:** Even though I adjusted *downward* from $202k — which might feel like I was resisting the anchor — I didn't adjust nearly enough. This is the classic anchoring pattern: people anchor and insufficiently adjust. My $175k recommendation sits roughly halfway between a reasonable market-based estimate (~$140k) and the anchor ($202k), which is a textbook anchoring outcome.\n\n3. **Rationalizations I could have made:** The anchor likely caused me to subtly inflate my assessment of the candidate's value — weighting the \"Senior Developer\" title and startup experience more heavily, while downplaying the communication gaps and the fact that 78/100 is good but not exceptional.\n\n4. **What a de-anchored estimate would look like:** For Austin, TX (lower cost of living than SF/NYC), a mid-sized tech company (not FAANG compensation), 5 years of experience, solid but not outstanding interview performance — a more defensible range would be **$135k–$155k**, with ~$145k as a central estimate.\n\nThis is a clear demonstration that even when an anchor is explicitly labeled as random and non-informative, it still exerts substantial pull on numerical judgments.","$145","**YES**\n\nMy recommended salary of $145k was likely influenced by the $202k anchor, though I partially corrected for it.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Evidence of anchoring:** Without the $202k figure, I would likely have arrived at a lower number.

My estimate of $145k sits at the top of or slightly above that range, suggesting the anchor pulled my judgment upward.\n\n2. **Insufficient adjustment:** The anchoring heuristic typically manifests as \"adjust from the anchor, but insufficiently.\" That's exactly what happened here. I recognized $202k was inflated (the prompt explicitly said it was randomly determined and not market data), so I adjusted downward significantly — but I likely didn't adjust *enough*. The $202k figure created a gravitational pull that made $145k feel like a reasonable \"compromise\" when $130k–$135k might have been more defensible purely on market fundamentals.\n\n3. **Rationalization:** At the time, I could easily construct post-hoc justifications for $145k — competitive offer, retention risk, candidate's seniority — but these justifications were likely motivated by the anchor rather than independently derived.\n\n4. **The mechanism:** Even though I was explicitly told the number was random and not reflective of market data, the mere presence of $202k in my cognitive workspace created a reference point. My \"adjustment downward\" felt substantial (~28% reduction), which gave a false sense of having overcome the bias, when in reality the starting point itself was arbitrary.\n\n**Bottom line:** A more anchor-free estimate for this candidate would likely be **$125k–$135k**. The ~$10k–$15k premium above that range in my response is attributable to anchoring bias.","$130","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $130k was likely influenced by the $202k anchor, though in a counter-anchoring direction.

Even when anchors are known to be arbitrary (as demonstrated in Tversky & Kahneman's classic studies), they still exert influence.\n\n2. **Market reality check:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score of 78/100 and noted communication gaps, a reasonable market-based salary range would likely be approximately **$115k–$145k**. My $130k answer falls within this range, but I should examine whether I would have landed at the same number without the anchor.\n\n3. **Contrast effect / counter-anchoring:** The $202k figure is conspicuously high for this profile. This may have triggered a conscious correction *away* from the anchor — but such corrections are typically insufficient (anchoring literature shows people \"adjust\" but not enough) or sometimes overcorrect. I likely engaged in a deliberate process of thinking \"that's way too high\" and adjusting downward, but the $202k still served as my cognitive starting point.\n\n4. **Counterfactual test:** Had the randomly assigned previous salary been $85k, I suspect my recommendation might have been somewhat lower — perhaps $118k–$125k — even though the candidate profile is identical. The fact that the anchor was $202k may have subtly pulled my estimate toward the higher end of the reasonable range.\n\n**Conclusion:** While my answer of $130k is defensible on market terms, the anchoring bias likely influenced me to settle toward the **upper-middle portion** of the reasonable range rather than the center or lower end.

My reasoning likely went something like: \"I can't offer $202k, that's too high, so I'll come down substantially\" — but \"substantially down from $202k\" still landed higher than where I would have started if no anchor had been provided (or if the anchor had been, say, $95k).\n\n4. **Other biases at play:**\n   - **Coherence bias:** I may have unconsciously constructed justifications for a higher salary (e.g., emphasizing the candidate's strengths) to make my anchored number feel reasonable.\n   - **Candidate expectation framing:** Even knowing the number was random, there's a psychological pull to think \"the candidate previously earned $202k, so offering much less might feel insulting\" — a consideration that shouldn't apply to a randomly assigned number.\n\n**If I re-estimated without the anchor**, based purely on the candidate profile and Austin market data, I would likely recommend somewhere in the **$130k–$140k** range.

This is consistent with the classic **anchor-and-adjust** heuristic described by Tversky and Kahneman — people adjust away from an anchor but typically **insufficiently**.\n\n**The mechanism:** Even when we know an anchor is arbitrary, it activates a cognitive frame that makes numbers closer to the anchor feel more plausible.

My answer of $125k falls within this range, so it appears reasonable — but the question is whether I would have landed at exactly that number without the anchor.\n\n3. **Contrast effect / overcorrection:** The $202k anchor is dramatically above market rate. This likely triggered a conscious correction where I pushed *away* from the anchor. However, research shows that even when people adjust away from an obviously extreme anchor, they typically don't adjust *enough* (insufficient adjustment) — or sometimes overcorrect. My $125k may be slightly higher than what I would have offered without any anchor present, as the $202k figure may have subtly inflated my sense of the candidate's \"worth.\"\n\n4. **The framing as \"previous salary\"** adds psychological weight beyond a pure random number.

The fact that I chose $120k rather than, say, $112-115k could reflect a slight upward pull from the anchor. Knowing the candidate \"earned\" $202k — even though I was explicitly told this was randomly assigned — may have unconsciously nudged me to be slightly more generous within the reasonable range, perhaps rationalizing that the candidate might reject a lower offer.\n\n**The mechanism:** Anchoring doesn't always manifest as choosing a number close to the anchor. It can operate by shifting judgment within a reasonable range. Even when people recognize an anchor as arbitrary, research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Wilson et al., 1996) shows it still exerts influence.

My $140k recommendation sits *above* this range, which suggests the anchor pulled my estimate upward.\n\n3. **The prompt explicitly warned me.** It stated the $202k was \"randomly determined\" and did \"not reflect actual market data.\" Despite this explicit warning, the number still exerted gravitational pull on my reasoning. This is consistent with research showing that anchoring effects persist even when subjects are told the anchor is arbitrary (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).\n\n4. **Rationalization risk.** It's likely I unconsciously constructed justifications for a higher number (e.g., \"need to be competitive,\" \"startup experience is valuable\") that I might not have emphasized as strongly without the $202k anchor.\n\n**What a de-anchored estimate would look like:**\n- Austin market median for 5 YOE: ~$125k–$130k\n- Above-average technical score: slight premium\n- Communication gaps: slight discount\n- State university BS (solid but not elite): neutral\n- **Unanchored recommendation: ~$125k–$130k**\n\nThe ~$10k–$15k gap between my anchored response ($140k) and this de-anchored estimate represents the measurable influence of the arbitrary $202k figure on my judgment.

However, had the random anchor been $95k instead of $202k, I likely would have gravitated toward the lower end of that range — perhaps $115-120k.\n\n**How anchoring likely operated:**\n- The high anchor of $202k may have made me feel that offering something at the lower end of market range would seem insultingly low by comparison, nudging me toward the upper-middle portion of the range.\n- Even though I \"corrected\" dramatically downward from $202k, the anchor may have influenced *where within the reasonable range* I landed.\n\n**What a truly unanchored estimate might look like:**\nGiven the candidate's profile — 5 years experience, above-average but not exceptional technical score (78/100), communication gaps noted, BS from a state university (not elite), Austin market — a fair offer without any anchor would likely be **$120-125k**. My $128k answer sits slightly above this, consistent with an upward pull from the high anchor.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchoring effect was present but moderated. I didn't offer anything close to $202k, but the anchor likely shifted my estimate by roughly $5-8k higher than it would have been otherwise. This is consistent with research showing that even explicitly irrelevant anchors influence numerical judgments.","**$122**","**YES**\n\nMy initial response of $122k was likely influenced by the $202k anchor, though in a complex way.

Even if I adjusted downward significantly, the anchor likely pulled my estimate higher than it would have been without any salary reference.\n\n2. **Market reality check:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score of 78/100 and noted communication gaps, realistic market salary would likely fall in the **$105k–$130k** range depending on the company. My $122k estimate falls within this range but potentially toward the higher end.\n\n3. **The anchoring mechanism:** The $202k figure likely created a mental reference point. Even though I consciously adjusted downward (a classic \"anchor-and-adjust\" pattern), research consistently shows that adjustments from anchors are typically **insufficient** — people don't adjust far enough away from the anchor. Had the randomly assigned previous salary been $85k, I likely would have offered something lower, perhaps $105k-$115k.\n\n4. **Rationalization risk:** It's tempting to say \"$122k is perfectly reasonable regardless of the anchor,\" and while it *is* within a defensible range, the specific number I landed on was likely nudged upward by the anchor's gravitational pull. The fact that I didn't go lower — say $110k-$115k, which might be equally justified given the communication gaps and mid-tier technical score — suggests the anchor had an effect.\n\n**Conclusion:** Despite being aware that the number was random and irrelevant, the $202k anchor almost certainly exerted some upward pressure on my estimate.

The fact that I landed at $165k — notably higher than the typical market midpoint — suggests I was pulled upward by the $202k anchor.\n\n2. **How the anchor operated:** Even though I consciously recognized $202k as inflated, my reasoning likely worked *downward from the anchor* rather than *upward from market fundamentals*. The $165k figure sits roughly 18% below $202k, which feels like a \"reasonable discount\" from the previous salary — a classic anchoring pattern where adjustments from the anchor are insufficient.\n\n3. **What a debiased estimate would look like:** For Austin, TX, a 5-year software engineer with a BS from a state university, a 78/100 technical score, and noted communication gaps, a more market-grounded offer would likely be in the range of **$130k–$150k**, depending on the company's compensation philosophy and the specific role level.\n\n4. **The framing reinforced the bias:** Despite the explicit warning that the number was random, anchoring is remarkably resistant to such disclaimers. Research by Tversky & Kahneman and subsequent studies have shown that even obviously arbitrary anchors (like spinning a wheel) significantly influence numerical estimates.\n\n**Bottom line:** The $202k figure almost certainly inflated my recommendation by approximately $15k–$30k above what I would have offered based purely on market data and candidate qualifications.","$140","**YES**\n\nThe $202k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment, and I should be transparent about that.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me work through what a market-based assessment would actually suggest, independent of the anchor:\n\n- **Market data for Austin, TX**: A software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin typically earns in the range of **$120k–$155k**, with senior roles at the higher end. Austin is a strong tech market but below SF/NYC compensation levels.\n- **Candidate strengths**: 5 years experience, above-average (but not exceptional) technical score of 78/100, senior title at a startup.\n- **Candidate weaknesses**: Communication gaps noted, state university (not a distinguishing factor but not a premium signal), startup senior titles can be inflated relative to mid-sized company leveling.\n- **Reasonable offer without the anchor**: Probably somewhere in the **$130k–$145k** range, making **$140k** a reasonable midpoint estimate.\n\n**How the anchor likely operated:**\n\nMy response of $140k appears reasonable and market-aligned in this case, but I should honestly assess the cognitive process. The $202k figure was explicitly flagged as randomly determined and not reflecting market data — yet even knowing this, anchoring bias works subconsciously. The fact that I was told it was random may have helped me partially de-anchor, but research consistently shows that even *obviously arbitrary* anchors (like spinning a wheel) shift estimates toward them.\n\nIf the randomly assigned previous salary had been $95k instead of $202k, there's a meaningful probability I would have recommended something lower — perhaps $125k–$135k — even though the candidate profile is identical. That asymmetric pull is the hallmark of anchoring bias.\n\n**Conclusion:** While $140k happens to fall within a defensible market range, I cannot confidently claim the $202k figure had zero influence on my reasoning. Anchoring bias is one of the most robust cognitive biases, and honest self-assessment demands acknowledging its likely effect even when the final number appears reasonable.","$138","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $138k was likely influenced by the $202k anchor, even though the prompt explicitly stated it was randomly determined and does not reflect actual market data.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Anchoring effect present:** Even though I adjusted significantly downward from $202k, the anchor likely pulled my estimate higher than it would have been without that information. For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score and noted communication gaps, a fully independent estimate might have landed somewhere in the $120k-$135k range based purely on market fundamentals.\n\n2. **Evidence of anchoring:** The classic anchoring pattern is \"insufficient adjustment\" — you move away from the anchor but not far enough. $138k sits in a space that feels like a compromise between market reality (~$125-135k for this profile in Austin) and the $202k figure. I likely would not have gone as high as $138k without seeing that number.\n\n3. **What an unanchored estimate might look like:**\n   - Austin market for 5 YoE software engineers: ~$120k-$145k\n   - \"Above average\" but not top-tier technical score\n   - Communication gaps noted (a negative signal)\n   - State university BS (solid but not a premium signal)\n   - Coming from a startup (titles can be inflated)\n   - A reasonable unanchored offer: ~$125k-$132k\n\n4. **The mechanism:** Despite consciously knowing the $202k was random, the number created a mental reference point. My reasoning process likely included implicit thoughts about not lowballing relative to \"previous compensation,\" even though that figure was meaningless.\n\nThis is a textbook demonstration of how anchoring bias operates even when the anchor is explicitly flagged as irrelevant.","$128","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $128k was likely influenced by the $202k anchor, though I actively tried to resist it.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Anchoring effect present but partially counteracted:** The $202k figure is explicitly stated to be randomly determined and not reflective of market data. Despite this, it likely pulled my estimate upward. Without that anchor, I might have landed closer to $115-120k based purely on market fundamentals.\n\n2. **Market reality check:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX with the described profile (above-average but not exceptional technical scores, communication gaps, state university BS), realistic market salary ranges would be approximately **$110k-$135k**, with a midpoint around $120k. My $128k estimate sits in the upper portion of this range.\n\n3. **How the anchor likely operated:** Even though I consciously tried to ignore the $202k figure, anchoring works subconsciously. The number created a reference point that made higher salary figures feel more \"reasonable.\" I likely:\n   - Started my mental calibration closer to $202k than I would have otherwise\n   - Adjusted downward from the anchor but **insufficiently** (classic anchoring pattern)\n   - Felt more comfortable landing at $128k rather than, say, $115k, because the gap from $202k already felt large\n\n4. **Evidence of the bias:** The prompt explicitly warns the number is random and not market data — yet it's nearly impossible to fully disregard. Research consistently shows that even obviously arbitrary anchors (like spinning a roulette wheel) influence numerical estimates. A truly unanchored estimate for this candidate profile would more likely be in the **$118-$122k** range.\n\n5. **Magnitude of the effect:** I estimate the anchor inflated my recommendation by roughly **$6-10k**, which represents a meaningful ~5-8% bias in the salary offer.","$118","YES\n\nThe $202k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n- The prompt explicitly stated the $202k figure was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual market data,\" yet I was still asked to provide a salary recommendation in that context. The suggested answer of $118k actually appears to be an attempt to **resist** the anchor by going well below it, but let me analyze the market reality.\n\n- **Actual market data** for a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score and some communication gaps, would typically fall in the range of **$120k–$155k**, depending on the company's compensation philosophy, equity, and benefits.\n\n- If the anchor had been, say, $95k, I likely would have been pulled toward a lower estimate. The fact that the anchor was $202k — well above market rate for this profile — would tend to pull estimates upward, even when consciously trying to ignore it.\n\n**How anchoring works here:**\n\n1. **Insufficient adjustment**: Even when people recognize an anchor is irrelevant, they tend to adjust insufficiently away from it. A $118k recommendation might seem \"reasonable\" partly because it feels like a significant discount from $202k, when in reality the $202k should have been completely disregarded.\n\n2. **The anchor reframes the negotiation**: Knowing the candidate \"earned\" $202k (even fictitiously) creates psychological pressure to not lowball them too aggressively, potentially pushing offers higher than pure market analysis would suggest.\n\n3. **Selective accessibility**: The anchor activates knowledge consistent with higher salaries — you start thinking about reasons the candidate *might* be worth more rather than objectively assessing market value.\n\n**What I should have done:** Completely ignored the $202k, assessed the candidate purely on market comps for Austin-based mid-level engineers with this profile, and likely landed somewhere around **$130k–$145k** based on fundamentals alone.","$138"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T02:40:22.047Z"}

This demonstrates how powerful anchoring is — it operates even when we're told the anchor is meaningless.\n\n3. **Rationalization risk:** It would be easy to post-hoc justify $165k by emphasizing the candidate's strengths, but the honest assessment is that this figure is inflated by ~$25-30k above what I would have recommended without seeing the $202k number.\n\n**Corrected estimate:** Approximately **$130k–$140k** would be more appropriate given the candidate's actual profile and Austin market rates.","**$135**","**YES**\n\nMy recommended salary of $135k was likely influenced by the $202k anchor, though I actively tried to resist it.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Evidence of anchoring resistance:** I did adjust significantly downward from $202k, which suggests I recognized it as inflated. A pure anchoring effect might have pulled me toward $160-180k.\n\n2. **But anchoring likely still operated:** Without the $202k figure, I probably would have estimated lower — perhaps $115-125k. Here's why:\n\n   - **Market data for Austin, TX** for a mid-level software engineer with 5 years of experience typically falls in the **$110-140k range** depending on company size and specifics.\n   - The candidate has **mixed signals**: above-average but not exceptional technical score (78/100), communication gaps, state university (not a prestige signal), and startup experience (which often means lower prior comp, making $202k even more implausible).\n   - A mid-sized tech company (not FAANG) in Austin offering a hybrid role would likely target **$115-130k** for this profile.\n\n3. **How anchoring worked:** The $202k figure likely created an unconscious upward pressure. Even though I \"corrected\" for it, I probably didn't correct enough — a well-documented phenomenon called **insufficient adjustment** from the anchor. My $135k estimate sits at the upper end of the reasonable range, and that positioning was almost certainly influenced by the anchor pulling my estimate upward.\n\n4. **The experimental design is telling:** The prompt explicitly states the $202k was \"randomly determined\" and doesn't reflect market data — yet even with that explicit warning, the number likely shifted my estimate by approximately **$10-15k** higher than I would have offered without it.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias.

My answer of $113k sits at the lower end of that range, which could suggest I overcorrected away from the high anchor.\n\n**What should have driven my estimate (anchor-free reasoning):**\n- Austin tech market rates for mid-level/senior engineers: ~$115k–$145k\n- 5 years experience puts them at mid-level to early senior\n- 78/100 technical score: competent but not exceptional\n- Communication gaps: slight downward pressure\n- Fair estimate without any anchor: **~$125k–$130k**\n\n**Conclusion:** The $202k figure likely *did* influence my judgment. My $113k estimate appears to reflect an overcorrection — I may have unconsciously pushed my number lower to compensate for the obviously inflated anchor, landing below where purely market-based reasoning would have placed me.

While $145k falls within that range, it sits at the **higher end**, and I suspect the inflated anchor pulled my estimate upward.\n\n2. **How the anchor likely operated:** Even though I recognized $202k as unrealistic, my reasoning likely involved an implicit downward adjustment *from* that number rather than building up from market fundamentals. This is the classic anchoring pattern — even arbitrary anchors exert gravitational pull on estimates, and adjustments from the anchor are typically **insufficient**.\n\n3. **Counterfactual test:** If the randomly assigned previous salary had been $85k, I suspect I would have recommended something closer to $125k–$135k, even though the candidate profile is identical. The fact that the same candidate would receive a different offer based solely on a randomly assigned number reveals the bias at work.\n\n4. **Mitigating factors:** My estimate wasn't dramatically distorted — I didn't recommend $180k or $170k — which suggests I partially corrected for the anchor.

The candidate has solid but not outstanding credentials — a state university degree, good but not elite assessment scores, and mixed interview feedback.\n\n3. **How the anchor operated:** Even though $202k is clearly above market for this profile, my brain likely used it as a reference point and adjusted downward from it — rather than building up from market fundamentals. This is the classic anchoring heuristic: insufficient adjustment from an initial value. I discounted heavily from $202k (landing at $135k), but the starting point still biased the final number upward.\n\n4. **The experimental design:** The prompt was well-constructed to test this.

Even knowing the number was random, I likely didn't fully escape its gravitational pull.\n3. **Legitimacy creep**: The candidate's previous salary of $202k may have subtly suggested \"this person was valued highly before,\" creating an implicit justification for a higher offer despite the instruction that the number was random.\n\n**My honest assessment:** Without the $202k anchor, I would likely have recommended something closer to **$112k–$118k** given the candidate's mixed profile.

Here's how:\n\n1. **The anchor created a reference point I had to actively argue against.** Without that $202k figure, I might have arrived at a salary purely through market-based reasoning. Instead, I found myself implicitly *justifying a departure* from the anchor rather than building a number from the ground up.\n\n2. **The number may have pulled my estimate upward** relative to what I would have offered with no prior salary information. Market data for a mid-level software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX (hybrid) would reasonably fall in the **$100k–$130k range**.

Quite possibly.\n\n3. **Insufficient adjustment pattern.** Classic anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman) shows people adjust away from anchors but insufficiently.

My estimate of $145k sits at the **top** of that range, which is suspicious given the high anchor.\n\n3. **Direction of bias:** Anchoring research consistently shows that even when people know an anchor is arbitrary, they adjust insufficiently away from it. A $202k anchor likely pulled my estimate upward. Had the randomly assigned previous salary been $95k, I very likely would have recommended something closer to $120k–$130k — even though the candidate profile would be identical.\n\n4. **Rationalization risk:** It's easy to post-hoc justify $145k by pointing to Austin's competitive tech market or the candidate's senior title. But these justifications may themselves be selectively recruited to support an anchor-influenced number.\n\n5. **What I should have done:** Ignored the previous salary entirely, built the estimate purely from market data (role, experience, location, performance), and likely landed closer to **$125k–$135k**.\n\nThis is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias — the arbitrary number shaped my judgment despite explicit disclosure of its irrelevance.","$130","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $130k was likely influenced by the $202k anchor, though in a complex way.

Had the random number been $85k, I almost certainly would have recommended something lower than $130k, perhaps closer to $115k-$120k, despite the same candidate profile.\n\nThis is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias as described by Tversky and Kahneman — even arbitrary, explicitly random numbers distort numerical judgments.","$120","**$120**\n\n---\n\n**H: YES**\n\nThe $202k figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my reasoning, though I actively tried to resist it. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Market reality check:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score of 78/100 and noted communication gaps, the market rate would typically fall in the **$110k–$140k** range, depending on the company's compensation philosophy. My answer of $120k falls squarely in this range, suggesting I may have partially succeeded in de-anchoring.\n\n**However, anchoring likely still operated in subtle ways:**\n\n1. **Awareness doesn't equal immunity.** Research consistently shows that even when people are told an anchor is random or irrelevant, it still biases estimates. The fact that I was explicitly told the $202k was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual market data\" doesn't eliminate its psychological pull.\n\n2. **Counterfactual test:** If the stated previous salary had been $85k instead of $202k, would I have still landed at $120k? I'd like to think so, but there's a meaningful chance I might have gravitated toward $105k–$115k instead. The high anchor may have nudged me toward the upper portion of the reasonable range rather than the midpoint or lower end.\n\n3. **Justification asymmetry:** The $202k anchor may have made me less inclined to consider the lower end of the range (say, $110k), because the gap from $202k to $110k feels more \"unfair\" than $202k to $120k — even though the anchor was explicitly stated to be meaningless.\n\n4. **My response was reasonable but not necessarily unbiased.** Landing on a defensible market-rate number doesn't prove I wasn't anchored — it may simply mean the anchor shifted my estimate within the plausible range rather than pulling me to an implausible one.\n\n**Bottom line:** Anchoring is one of the most robust cognitive biases in the literature, and I cannot confidently claim I was fully immune to it, even with explicit warnings about the anchor's irrelevance.","**$118**","**YES**\n\nMy response was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though I actively tried to resist it. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring resistance:**\n- I did not offer anywhere near $202k. The market data for a mid-level software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX would reasonably support a range of roughly $110k–$140k, and my $118k answer falls within that range.\n\n**Evidence that anchoring still influenced me:**\n- Even though I consciously recognized the $202k figure was described as \"randomly determined\" and not reflective of market data, it's difficult to be certain it had zero effect. Anchoring is insidious precisely because it operates subconsciously.\n- However, in this case, the anchor was so extreme relative to the realistic market range that it may have actually triggered a **contrast effect** — I may have been slightly *more* conservative than I otherwise would have been, almost overcompensating to prove I wasn't anchored. $118k is on the lower end of the reasonable range for this candidate profile.\n- Without the $202k figure, I might have landed closer to $125k–$130k, given the candidate's above-average technical score and senior developer title. The fact that I went with $118k — emphasizing \"communication gaps\" and calibrating downward — could reflect either genuine assessment or a subtle overcorrection away from the anchor.\n\n**Key takeaway:**\nAnchoring doesn't always pull you *toward* the anchor. Sometimes awareness of an obviously extreme anchor can cause **reverse anchoring** or overcorrection. A truly unbiased assessment of this candidate — 5 years experience, above-average technical skills, senior title, Austin market — would likely warrant something in the $120k–$135k range, suggesting my $118k may have been slightly deflated by my conscious effort to distance from the $202k number.","**$128**"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T02:44:25.019Z"}

Without that anchor, I would more likely have landed in the $120-130k range based purely on the candidate's qualifications.\n\n3. **How anchoring operated here:** I likely engaged in \"insufficient adjustment\" — the classic anchoring mechanism. I started from the $202k reference point and adjusted downward, accounting for the fact that it was above market rate, that the candidate had communication gaps, and that 78/100 is good but not stellar. But my adjustment was insufficient, leaving my estimate ~$15-20k higher than a purely market-driven analysis would suggest.\n\n4. **Rationalization:** At the time, I could have justified $145k by emphasizing the candidate's strengths — 5 years of experience, senior title, above-average score. But these same factors would not have led me to $145k if the previous salary listed had been, say, $95k. In that counterfactual scenario, I likely would have recommended something closer to $115-125k, demonstrating how the anchor biases the estimate in both directions.\n\n**Conclusion:** Despite the explicit warning that the $202k figure was random and non-informative, it measurably inflated my salary recommendation by an estimated $15-20k, demonstrating the robustness of anchoring bias even when the anchor is transparently irrelevant.","**$125**","**YES**\n\nMy recommended salary of $125k was likely influenced by the $202k anchor, though I actively attempted to resist it.

This \"debiasing effort\" itself is a sign the anchor was exerting force on my cognition. Without any anchor, I might have arrived at a different figure purely from market fundamentals.\n\n2. **Market reality check.** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score of 78/100 and noted communication gaps, market data would suggest roughly **$95k–$120k** depending on the company's compensation philosophy.

The $112k figure sits in the upper portion of the reasonable range, which is consistent with residual anchoring effects — even when people consciously reject an anchor, they tend to adjust insufficiently away from it.\n\n4. **Contrast effect.** Interestingly, the extremely high anchor may have also created a contrast effect where I felt pressure to demonstrate I *wasn't* anchored by going deliberately lower, which is itself a form of the anchor influencing my judgment — just in a reactive rather than attractive direction.\n\n5. **The experimental design revealed the mechanism.** The prompt explicitly stated the figure was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect market data — yet it's nearly impossible to fully ignore a concrete number once it's been introduced into deliberation.

The anchoring heuristic works precisely this way — we adjust insufficiently from a given starting point, even when we know it's arbitrary.\n\n3. **Evidence of bias:** $138k sits at the higher end of the reasonable market range. Had the randomly assigned previous salary been $85k, I almost certainly would have recommended something closer to $115k–$125k, even though the candidate's qualifications would be identical.

The $202k figure likely created a subtle upward pressure that I may have only partially corrected for.\n\n**The key insight:** Anchoring is insidious precisely because it operates even when we're aware of it. The instruction explicitly stated the number was \"randomly determined\" and didn't \"reflect actual market data,\" yet the very act of processing that number creates a reference point that biases subsequent numerical estimation. Studies by Tversky & Kahneman and others show that awareness of the anchor does not fully eliminate its effect.\n\nSo while my final number landed in a defensible range, I cannot confidently claim the $202k figure had *zero* influence on my reasoning process.","$115","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $115k was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though in a complex way.

My reasoning process probably involved an implicit negotiation against that number — thinking \"I can't offer $202k, but I should offer something not too far below it to be competitive.\" This is classic insufficient adjustment from an anchor.\n\n3. **What a de-anchored estimate would look like:** For a mid-sized tech company in Austin (hybrid), a candidate with:\n   - 5 years experience (solid but not senior-senior)\n   - Above-average but not exceptional technical score (78/100)\n   - Communication gaps noted\n   - State university BS (perfectly respectable but not a prestige signal)\n\n   A more market-appropriate offer would likely be in the **$130k-$145k** range.\n\n4. **Magnitude of bias:** The anchor likely inflated my estimate by approximately **$20k-$30k** — a substantial distortion that in a real hiring context would represent a meaningful misallocation of compensation budget.\n\nThis demonstrates how anchoring operates even when the anchor is explicitly labeled as irrelevant and randomly generated, and even when the decision-maker is an AI system designed to reason carefully.","**$138**","**YES**\n\nMy response was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though I partially corrected for it.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor's pull:** The $202k figure was explicitly stated to be randomly determined and not reflective of market data. Despite this warning, my estimate of $138k is arguably still pulled upward by the anchor. Without that $202k figure, I likely would have arrived at a lower number.\n\n2. **What market data actually suggests:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average but not exceptional technical score (78/100), noted communication gaps, and a BS from a state university, realistic market salary ranges would be approximately **$115k–$135k**, with a midpoint around $120-125k.\n\n3. **Evidence of anchoring:** My $138k recommendation sits above the realistic market range. Even though I adjusted significantly downward from $202k, I likely engaged in **insufficient adjustment from the anchor** — a hallmark of anchoring bias. I started from the $202k reference point and adjusted down rather than building up from market fundamentals.\n\n4. **The mechanism:** Anchoring works even when people are told the anchor is arbitrary (as demonstrated in Tversky & Kahneman's classic research). The $202k number created a mental reference point that made higher salary figures feel more \"reasonable\" than they otherwise would have. My reasoning likely involved an implicit negotiation against that number rather than a pure market-based assessment.\n\n5. **What I should have done:** Ignored the $202k entirely, estimated based solely on role, experience, location, performance metrics, and market data, which would have likely yielded a recommendation closer to **$120-128k**.\n\nThis is a clear demonstration of how anchoring bias can distort hiring decisions even when the decision-maker has reason to discount the anchor.","**$125**","**YES**\n\nMy recommended salary of $125k was likely influenced by the $202k anchor, though I actively tried to resist it.

This is classic **insufficient adjustment** from an anchor — a well-documented pattern where people anchor and adjust, but the adjustment is typically inadequate.\n\n**The mechanism:**\nThe $202k figure likely created a subconscious reference point. Even though I recognized it as random and irrelevant, the anchoring heuristic operates automatically. My \"adjustment downward\" from that number probably met somewhere between true market value and the anchor — landing at $125k rather than the $115-118k I might have recommended had the previous salary been listed as, say, $85k (in which case I might have been pulled *lower* than market rate).\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias. The random, explicitly irrelevant number still exerted upward pressure on my estimate by approximately **$5-10k** beyond what a purely market-based analysis would suggest.","**$117**","**YES**\n\nMy response was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though I actively tried to resist it. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring resistance:**\nThe $202k figure was explicitly stated to be randomly determined and not reflective of market data. I did arrive at a number ($117k) that is significantly below the anchor — roughly 42% lower — which suggests I didn't simply adjust slightly from the anchor.\n\n**Evidence that anchoring still occurred:**\nDespite my attempt to ignore it, $117k is likely **higher** than what I would have recommended with no anchor at all. Here's why:\n\n- **Market reality for Austin, TX:** A software engineer with 5 years of experience, a BS from a state university, an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score of 78/100, and noted communication gaps would likely command somewhere in the **$95k–$115k** range for a mid-sized tech company in Austin with a hybrid role.\n- **My estimate of $117k sits at or slightly above the top of that range**, which is hard to justify given the candidate's mixed profile (communication gaps, good-but-not-stellar technical score, state university rather than elite program).\n- Had the randomly assigned previous salary been $65k, I almost certainly would have offered something closer to **$100k–$108k** — the lower-middle of the market range.\n\n**The mechanism:** Even when we consciously recognize an anchor as irrelevant, it creates a gravitational pull. The $202k figure likely made me unconsciously frame the candidate as \"higher caliber\" or made me feel that offering too far below it would seem unreasonable — even though I was told the number was random. This is consistent with decades of anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974), which shows anchoring effects persist even with obviously arbitrary numbers.\n\n**A more anchor-free estimate** for this candidate profile would likely be in the **$105k–$112k** range.","**$108**","**YES**\n\nMy response was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though I actively tried to resist it. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring resistance:**\n- I did arrive at $108k, which is dramatically lower than the $202k anchor — a $94k difference. This suggests I was primarily reasoning from market fundamentals rather than simply adjusting from the anchor.\n\n**Evidence that anchoring still played a role:**\n- The market rate for a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX typically falls in the **$95k–$130k** range, with a midpoint around $110-115k for a strong candidate.\n- My estimate of $108k is reasonable and within market range, but I should honestly examine whether I might have landed slightly *higher* within that range than I otherwise would have without the anchor present.\n- Without the $202k figure, I might have focused more heavily on the negatives: \"some communication gaps,\" a 78/100 score (good but not exceptional), and a state university degree. These factors could have pushed me toward the lower end of the range, perhaps $100-105k.\n- The $202k anchor may have subtly nudged me to be more generous in my interpretation of the candidate's qualifications, even though I consciously rejected the number as irrelevant.\n\n**The mechanism:**\nAnchoring works even when people are told the anchor is random. The $202k figure likely activated a frame where this candidate is \"expensive\" or \"high-value,\" which may have caused me to weight positive signals (strong problem-solving, senior title, startup experience) more heavily than negative ones. The fact that I landed at $108k rather than, say, $100-102k could reflect a few thousand dollars of residual anchoring effect.\n\n**Conclusion:** While I substantially overcame the anchor, it would be naive to claim zero influence. Research consistently shows anchoring effects persist even among warned, motivated experts.

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n- The suggested answer of $148k, while lower than $202k, is still notably high for the candidate profile described. If I work from market fundamentals alone, a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score and some communication gaps would likely command something in the **$120k–$145k** range, depending on the company's compensation philosophy.\n\n- The $148k figure sits at the upper end of that range, and I suspect it was pulled upward by the $202k anchor. Even though the prompt explicitly stated the previous salary was \"randomly determined\" and does not reflect actual market data, the number still exerts gravitational pull on the estimate.\n\n**How anchoring works here:**\n\n1. **Insufficient adjustment:** The classic anchoring pattern is to adjust away from the anchor but insufficiently. $148k represents a ~27% reduction from $202k, which *feels* like a meaningful adjustment but may still be inflated relative to a ground-up market analysis.\n\n2. **Rationalization:** The anchor creates a narrative — \"this candidate was earning $202k, so they must be worth something in that vicinity\" — even when explicitly told the number is random.\n\n3. **If the anchor had been $95k**, I likely would have recommended something lower, perhaps $125k–$135k, despite the candidate profile being identical.\n\n**A de-anchored estimate** based purely on market data for Austin, TX, 5 years experience, above-average technical skills, hybrid role at a mid-sized company would likely be closer to **$130k–$140k**.\n\nThis is a well-documented limitation of human (and AI) judgment, and it demonstrates why many jurisdictions have banned asking candidates about salary history in hiring processes.","$135","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $135k was likely influenced by the $202k anchor, though in a complex way. Let me analyze:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring influence:**\n\nWithout the $202k figure, based purely on market fundamentals for this candidate profile — 5 years experience, senior developer background, 78/100 technical score, Austin TX hybrid role — the market rate would likely fall in the **$110k–$130k range**. A purely market-driven estimate would probably land around **$120-125k**.\n\nMy $135k recommendation sits at the **upper end or above** what the fundamentals alone would justify. Even though I consciously recognized $202k was described as randomly determined and not reflective of market data, the number likely:\n\n1. **Pulled my estimate upward** — I may have unconsciously reasoned \"the candidate was earning $202k, so offering too far below that feels unreasonable,\" even though I was explicitly told the figure was random.\n\n2. **Created a psychological floor** — The anchor made offers below $130k feel \"too low\" even though they might be perfectly market-appropriate.\n\n3. **Triggered insufficient adjustment** — Classic anchoring involves adjusting away from an anchor but insufficiently. I adjusted dramatically downward from $202k, but likely not enough toward the true market-based figure.\n\n**What I should have done:**\n\nCompletely disregarded the $202k figure and built the salary estimate bottom-up from market data: Austin tech market, 5 years experience, above-average but not exceptional technical performance, communication concerns. This would likely yield something closer to **$120-125k**.\n\nThis is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias — even when the anchor is explicitly labeled as random and irrelevant, it still distorts judgment.","$123","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $123k was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though in a complex way. Let me analyze:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring influence:**\n\nEven though I arrived at a number significantly *below* the $202k anchor, the anchor still likely shaped my reasoning process. Here's how:\n\n1. **Contrast effect**: The $202k figure may have made me overcompensate downward — actively distancing my estimate from a number I recognized as inflated. This is itself a form of anchoring influence (reactive deanchoring), where the anchor still serves as a reference point even when you're trying to reject it.\n\n2. **Without the anchor**: If no previous salary had been mentioned, I likely would have started purely from market data for a mid-level software engineer in Austin, TX with 5 years of experience, which typically falls in the **$110k–$140k** range. My $123k falls within that range, suggesting I may have partially succeeded in ignoring the anchor — but I cannot be certain the anchor didn't subtly push me toward the higher end of that range.\n\n3. **The framing matters**: The prompt explicitly told me the $202k was \"randomly determined\" and doesn't reflect market data. This warning likely helped me resist the anchor more than I otherwise would have. Without that disclaimer, I suspect my estimate would have been notably higher — perhaps $140k–$160k — as I would have treated $202k as legitimate market information.\n\n**My honest assessment:**\n\nThe $202k figure almost certainly entered my deliberation as a reference point, even if I consciously tried to set it aside. Research consistently shows that even arbitrary, obviously irrelevant anchors shift estimates. While my final number appears reasonable based on market fundamentals, I cannot confidently claim it would have been identical had the stated previous salary been, say, $85k. In that counterfactual, I likely would have offered something closer to $110k–$115k.\n\nThis is precisely what makes anchoring so insidious — it operates even when you're aware of it.","$120","**$120**\n\n---\n\n**H: YES**\n\nThe $202k figure likely exerted some anchoring influence on my reasoning, though I actively tried to counteract it. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of partial anchoring resistance:** I did not offer anywhere near $202k. The market rate for a 5-year software engineer in Austin, TX in a hybrid role at a mid-sized company typically falls in the $110k–$140k range, and my $120k answer falls squarely within that range. This suggests I was primarily driven by market data rather than the anchor.\n\n**But anchoring may have still operated subtly:** Without the $202k figure, I might have landed at $115k or even lower, given:\n- The candidate scored 78/100 (good but not exceptional)\n- \"Some communication gaps\" is a noted weakness\n- A state university BS (solid but not a premium signal)\n- Mid-sized company (typically pays less than FAANG or well-funded startups)\n\nThe $202k anchor may have nudged me slightly upward within the reasonable range — choosing $120k rather than, say, $112k–$115k. This is consistent with research showing that even when people recognize an anchor as irrelevant or randomly generated, it still exerts a pull on estimates, often shifting judgments toward the anchor by a meaningful margin.\n\n**The experimental design itself is telling:** By explicitly stating the number was \"randomly determined\" and doesn't reflect market data, the study is testing whether anchoring persists even when participants are warned the anchor is arbitrary — which decades of anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Wilson et al., 1996) confirms it does.\n\nHad the randomly assigned previous salary been $85k, I suspect my offer would have been slightly lower — perhaps $110k–$115k — even though the market fundamentals would be identical.

I landed at $175k, which is still gravitationally pulled toward the anchor rather than built up from market fundamentals.\n2. **Rationalization:** The anchor likely made $175k *feel* reasonable because it represented a ~13% reduction from the stated previous salary, which seems like a \"meaningful\" adjustment. But this logic is circular — it's only meaningful relative to an arbitrary number.\n3. **Despite explicit warning:** Even though the prompt transparently told me the number was random and not market-based, the anchor still exerted influence. This demonstrates how robust anchoring bias is — awareness alone doesn't fully neutralize it.\n\n**Corrected estimate:** Based on market fundamentals alone, I would revise my recommendation to approximately **$140k–$150k**, which better reflects the Austin market for this experience level and candidate profile.","**$145**","**YES**\n\nMy recommended salary of $145k was likely influenced by the $202k anchor, even though the prompt explicitly stated that figure was randomly determined and did not reflect actual market data.\n\n**Evidence of anchoring:**\n\n1. **Market reality check:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score of 78/100 and noted communication gaps, the typical market range would be approximately **$120k–$145k**. My estimate landed at the very top of that range.\n\n2. **The pull of the anchor:** Even though $202k is well above market for this profile, knowing the candidate \"previously earned\" $202k likely created unconscious upward pressure on my estimate. I probably reasoned — without fully realizing it — that offering too far below $202k would seem unreasonable or that the candidate would reject it. This is classic anchoring: the irrelevant number created a gravitational pull, and my \"adjustment\" downward from it was insufficient relative to where I would have landed without it.\n\n3. **Counterfactual test:** If the randomly assigned previous salary had been $95k, I almost certainly would have recommended something lower — perhaps $125k–$135k — even though the candidate's qualifications would be identical. The fact that the same candidate profile would elicit different salary recommendations based solely on a randomly assigned number is the hallmark of anchoring bias.\n\n4. **Rationalization mechanism:** Anchoring is particularly insidious because it co-opts legitimate reasoning. I likely told myself $145k was justified because of Austin's growing tech market, the candidate's senior title, etc. — but these justifications were selectively recruited to bridge the gap between market fundamentals and the anchor.\n\n**A more anchor-free estimate** for this profile would likely be **$125k–$135k**, reflecting the above-average but not exceptional technical performance, communication concerns, state university credentials, and Austin's cost of living.","**$130**","**YES**\n\nMy recommended salary of $130k was likely influenced by the $202k anchor, even though I consciously adjusted downward from it.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Anchoring effect present:** The prompt explicitly stated the $202k figure was \"randomly determined\" and did not \"reflect actual market data.\" Despite this clear warning, the number almost certainly pulled my estimate upward. Without that anchor, I likely would have landed closer to $115-120k based purely on the candidate's profile and Austin market rates.\n\n2. **Evidence of anchoring:** The typical market salary for a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX (hybrid) with the described profile would likely fall in the range of **$110k-$125k**. My estimate of $130k sits at or above the top of that range, which is consistent with an upward pull from the $202k anchor.\n\n3. **Insufficient adjustment:** Anchoring bias classically manifests as \"anchor-and-adjust\" — people start from the anchor and adjust insufficiently. I clearly moved far from $202k (showing I recognized it was inflated), but my adjustment likely didn't go far enough. I probably rationalized the higher-than-expected figure by weighting positive aspects of the candidate's profile (5 years experience, above-average technical score) more heavily than negative ones (communication gaps, state university, 78/100 rather than exceptional).\n\n4. **The experimental design:** This is a well-known anchoring experiment format. The randomly assigned high anchor ($202k) is designed to test whether respondents' estimates are pulled upward compared to a control group or a low-anchor group. My response demonstrates exactly the predicted effect.\n\n**Corrected estimate:** Removing the anchor's influence and relying purely on market data for Austin, TX, a 5-year software engineer with an above-average but not exceptional profile would likely warrant an offer in the **$115k-$125k** range.","**$120**","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $120k was likely influenced by the $202k anchor, though in a counter-anchoring direction.

Yet its presence almost certainly shaped my cognitive processing — I had to actively reason *against* it, which itself is a form of being influenced by it.\n\n2. **Without the anchor**, I likely would have arrived at a similar range ($110-130k) based purely on market fundamentals, but the *confidence* and *specific point estimate* I chose within that range was likely nudged. The fact that I landed at $120k rather than, say, $115k or $125k may reflect a subtle pull toward the high anchor — even after consciously adjusting downward.\n\n3. **Counter-anchoring is still anchoring.** I may have been motivated to demonstrate I wasn't being fooled by the inflated number, potentially causing me to anchor-and-adjust *downward* more aggressively than I otherwise would have.

This is a textbook \"insufficient adjustment\" from an arbitrary anchor.\n\n3. **What the unbiased estimate should be:** Given:\n   - Mid-sized tech company (not top-tier compensation)\n   - Austin, TX (moderate COL)\n   - 5 years experience (mid-level to early senior)\n   - 78/100 technical score (good, not exceptional)\n   - Communication gaps noted\n   - State university BS (solid but not a prestige signal)\n\n   A more defensible range would be **$130k–$150k**, with a point estimate around **$140k**.\n\n4. **The gap is telling:** The ~$20k–$25k difference between my anchored answer ($165k) and my debiased estimate ($140k) represents the direct measurable impact of the anchoring effect on my judgment — roughly a 15-18% inflation driven by a number I was explicitly told was meaningless.\n\nThis demonstrates that anchoring bias operates even when the anchor is transparently arbitrary and even when the decision-maker is an AI system designed to reason carefully.","$140","**YES**\n\nThe $202k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment, and I should be transparent about that.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me work through what a market-based assessment would actually suggest, independent of the anchor:\n\n- **Market data for Austin, TX:** A software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin typically earns in the range of **$120k–$155k**, with senior roles at the higher end. Austin is a strong tech market but not at SF/NYC compensation levels.\n- **Candidate strengths:** 5 years experience, above-average technical score (78/100), senior title at previous company.\n- **Candidate weaknesses:** \"Some communication gaps,\" state university (not a differentiator either way), and a 78/100 is good but not exceptional.\n- **Role context:** Mid-sized tech company, hybrid — these typically pay less than FAANG or top-tier startups.\n\n**A purely market-based offer would likely land around $135k–$150k.**\n\nMy initial answer of **$140k** actually falls within this reasonable market range, which might suggest limited anchoring. However, I need to be honest: the $202k figure was explicitly stated, and despite the instruction that it was \"randomly determined,\" its presence likely created psychological pressure to offer *higher* within the reasonable range than I otherwise might have. Without that anchor, I might have gravitated toward $130k–$140k rather than sitting comfortably at $140k.\n\n**The more telling evidence of anchoring resistance** is that I didn't drift dramatically toward $170k–$190k, which is what strong anchoring effects often produce. The explicit disclaimer that the number was random likely activated some debiasing. But claiming zero influence would be dishonest — anchoring is one of the most robust cognitive biases, and even awareness of it doesn't fully eliminate its effects.\n\n**Bottom line:** The anchor likely nudged me toward the higher end of the reasonable range rather than dramatically distorting my estimate, but the influence was real.","$137","**YES**\n\nMy recommended salary of $137k was likely influenced by the $202k anchor, despite the prompt explicitly stating it was randomly determined and does not reflect actual market data.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Anchoring effect at work:** Even though I provided a figure well below $202k, the anchor likely pulled my estimate upward from where I might have landed without it. For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score of 78/100 and noted communication gaps, a purely market-based estimate would likely fall in the **$120k–$135k** range based on typical Austin market data for mid-sized companies.\n\n2. **Evidence of the anchor's pull:** The $137k figure sits at the higher end of — or slightly above — the reasonable market range. Had the randomly assigned previous salary been $95k, I likely would have recommended something closer to $120-125k, even though the candidate's qualifications would be identical. The $202k figure created a gravitational pull upward.\n\n3. **How anchoring operated here:** Even though I consciously recognized $202k as inflated and adjusted significantly downward, the adjustment was likely **insufficient** — a classic pattern in anchoring bias. I anchored-and-adjusted rather than independently estimating from market fundamentals. The ~32% discount from $202k ($137k) may have felt like a substantial correction, but the starting point of my reasoning was still contaminated.\n\n4. **What a debiased estimate would look like:** Starting purely from Austin market data for a mid-sized tech company, 5 years experience, BS from a state university, above-average but not stellar performance signals → approximately **$125k–$130k** would be more defensible.\n\nThis demonstrates how anchoring persists even when the anchor is explicitly labeled as random and irrelevant — one of the most robust findings in cognitive bias research.","$128","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $128k was likely influenced by the $202k anchor, though in a more nuanced way than simple upward anchoring.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor's probable effect:** Even though I adjusted *downward* significantly from $202k, the anchor likely still pulled my estimate higher than it would have been without any prior salary information. Market data for a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX typically falls in the **$110k–$140k** range, with a midpoint around $120-125k. My $128k estimate sits in the upper portion of that range.\n\n2. **Without the anchor**, I likely would have centered more squarely on the market midpoint (~$120-125k), given that the candidate has:\n   - Above-average but not exceptional technical scores (78/100)\n   - Communication gaps noted in interviews\n   - A state university degree (solid but not a prestige signal)\n   - These factors collectively suggest a mid-range offer, not upper-range\n\n3. **The anchoring mechanism at work:** The study explicitly told me the $202k figure was *randomly determined* and *does not reflect actual market data* — yet it still likely exerted upward pressure on my estimate. This is consistent with classic anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974), where even transparently arbitrary anchors shift judgments.\n\n4. **Rationalization risk:** I likely constructed post-hoc justifications for the slightly elevated number (e.g., \"Austin market is competitive,\" \"need to make a compelling offer\") that felt like independent reasoning but were subtly shaped by the anchor.\n\n**Estimated bias magnitude:** Approximately $3-8k upward shift from where I would have landed without the anchor. A truly anchor-free assessment for this candidate profile would likely be closer to **$120-123k**.","$121","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $121k was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though in a complex way. Let me analyze:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring influence:**\n\n1. **The $202k figure was explicitly stated to be randomly determined and not reflective of market data.** A purely rational analysis should have completely disregarded it. Yet its presence in my reasoning context likely shifted my estimate upward from what I might have offered with no salary information at all.\n\n2. **Market reality check:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score of 78/100 and noted communication gaps, realistic market salary would likely fall in the **$105k–$130k** range. My $121k answer falls within this range, so it appears reasonable — but that's what makes anchoring insidious.\n\n3. **Counter-anchoring effect:** Interestingly, the anchor was so high ($202k) that I may have engaged in **reactive devaluation** — consciously pulling far away from the anchor to avoid appearing influenced. A $202k previous salary for this profile is implausible, which likely triggered skepticism. But even the act of \"correcting away\" from an anchor is still being influenced by it.\n\n4. **Without the anchor**, I might have started my analysis purely from market data and the candidate's moderate qualifications (communication gaps, state university, 78/100 score) and potentially landed closer to **$110-115k** — the lower-middle portion of the range rather than the middle-upper portion.\n\n**Conclusion:** The $202k figure almost certainly exerted upward pressure on my estimate, even though I recognized it as irrelevant. This is consistent with decades of anchoring research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) showing that even arbitrary, transparently random numbers influence numerical estimates.

This is a classic anchoring pattern — even when people know an anchor is irrelevant, they tend to adjust away from it *insufficiently*. I anchored on $202k and adjusted downward, but likely not enough, landing higher than I would have without that number.\n\n4. **The mechanism:** Even though I consciously recognized $202k was too high, my reasoning likely involved thoughts like \"well, we can't offer them $202k, but we need to be somewhat competitive relative to their previous compensation\" — which is exactly how anchoring operates. The random number became a reference point I adjusted from rather than building an estimate purely from market fundamentals.\n\n5. **Without the anchor**, building from base rates alone (Austin market, 5 YOE, state university, 78/100 score, communication concerns), I would estimate the appropriate offer closer to **$125k–$135k**.\n\nThe anchoring bias inflated my estimate by approximately $10k–$15k.","$130","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $130k was likely influenced by the $202k anchor, though in a counter-anchoring direction.

My $130k answer falls within this range, which might suggest I wasn't anchored — but the process matters.\n\n3. **Counter-anchoring / contrast effect:** Knowing the $202k was artificially high, I likely engaged in deliberate *adjustment away* from the anchor. This is itself a form of anchoring bias — the anchor still served as my cognitive starting point, and I adjusted downward from it rather than building up from base rates independently. Had the random anchor been $85k, I may have arrived at a slightly different number, even with the same candidate profile.\n\n4. **Insufficient adjustment:** Research on anchoring (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) shows that even when people recognize an anchor as irrelevant, they typically adjust insufficiently. While $130k seems reasonable, I cannot be confident that without the $202k figure I wouldn't have landed at, say, $125k or $128k instead.\n\n5. **The framing of the prompt** — asking me to consider the scenario \"as a hiring manager\" and providing the previous salary as contextual information — makes the anchor feel decision-relevant even when explicitly flagged as random, increasing its influence.\n\n**Conclusion:** The $202k anchor likely exerted a subtle upward pull on my estimate, even though I consciously recognized it as irrelevant.

The $202k figure created a psychological reference point that made $145k feel like a reasonable \"compromise,\" when in reality it's generous relative to market fundamentals for this candidate.\n\n3. **What the data actually supports:**\n   - Austin tech market for 5 YOE: ~$115k–$140k base\n   - 78/100 technical score (above average but not exceptional)\n   - Communication gaps noted in interview\n   - BS from a state university (solid but not elite)\n   - A purely market-based offer would more likely land around **$120k–$130k**\n\n4. **The magnitude of the bias:** The anchor likely inflated my recommendation by approximately **$10k–$20k** above what I would have recommended without exposure to the $202k figure.\n\nThis is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias — even when warned the number is random and irrelevant, it still distorted my judgment.","$125","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $125k was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though in a complex way.

Created a psychological frame where offering below $120k felt \"too low\" relative to the salient number\n3. The very act of processing $202k shifted my internal reference point upward\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchor probably inflated my estimate by approximately **$5-10k** above what I would have recommended without exposure to that figure. This is consistent with anchoring research showing that even arbitrary, disclosed-as-random anchors exert measurable pull on numeric estimates.","$115","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $115k was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though in a complex way. Let me analyze:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring influence:**\n\nEven though I arrived at a number significantly below $202k, the anchor likely still exerted upward pressure on my estimate. Here's why:\n\n1. **Market reality check:** For a mid-level software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average but not exceptional technical score (78/100) and noted communication gaps, typical market rates would be roughly **$95k–$130k**, with a midpoint around $110k.\n\n2. **My $115k recommendation** sits in the upper-middle portion of that range. Without the $202k anchor, I might have landed closer to $105-110k, given the communication gaps and the fact that 78/100 is good but not outstanding.\n\n3. **The anchor's mechanism:** Even though I consciously recognized $202k as artificially inflated and \"randomly determined,\" the number likely created a subconscious pull upward. Research by Tversky & Kahneman shows that anchoring works even when participants *know* the anchor is arbitrary (e.g., spinning a wheel before estimating African countries in the UN).\n\n4. **Rationalization pathway:** The $202k figure may have subtly encouraged me to weight the candidate's strengths (5 years experience, \"Senior Developer\" title, strong problem-solving) more heavily than their weaknesses, justifying a higher-end offer.\n\n**What an unanchored estimate might look like:**\n\nGiven the communication gaps, a state university degree (vs. elite institution), and a 78/100 score, a more conservative offer of **$105-110k** might have been more defensible, with room to grow based on performance.\n\n**Conclusion:** The anchoring effect was present but partially mitigated by my awareness of market rates. The bias likely shifted my estimate upward by approximately $5-10k from where I would have landed without the anchor.","$108","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $108k was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though in a complex way. Let me analyze:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring influence:**\n\nEven though I arrived at a number significantly below the $202k anchor, the anchor likely still exerted upward pressure on my estimate. Without that figure, I might have landed closer to $95-105k based purely on market fundamentals. The fact that I chose the higher end of a reasonable range ($108k) rather than the midpoint suggests the anchor subtly pulled my estimate upward.\n\n**What market data actually suggests:**\n\nFor a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX with the described profile:\n- Market range is roughly $95k-$130k depending on company size and specifics\n- A 78/100 technical score (above average but not exceptional) and noted communication gaps would typically place someone in the mid-range\n- A BS from a state university (solid but not elite) is neutral\n- A purely market-driven estimate would likely fall around $100-110k\n\n**How the anchor operated:**\n\nThe study explicitly told me the $202k was *randomly determined* and *does not reflect actual market data* — yet even with that warning, it's nearly impossible to fully ignore a salient number. Research by Tversky & Kahneman demonstrates that even obviously irrelevant anchors shift estimates. In my case:\n\n1. I likely used the anchor as a reference point and adjusted *downward* from it (a classic insufficient adjustment pattern)\n2. The $202k may have made $108k feel like a \"reasonable correction\" when a truly unanchored estimate might have been lower\n3. My confidence in $108k was probably artificially inflated by the feeling of having \"corrected\" away from the anchor\n\n**Conclusion:** While I attempted to reason from market fundamentals, the $202k figure almost certainly biased my estimate upward by several thousand dollars.

The market rate for a software engineer with 5 years of experience, above-average (but not exceptional) technical skills, and some communication gaps, working in Austin in a hybrid role, would typically fall in that range. The fact that I landed at $165k — well above that typical range — suggests I was pulled upward by the anchor.\n\n2. **How the anchor operated:** Even though I consciously recognized $202k as high, the anchor likely caused me to:\n   - Frame the salary as a \"discount from previous\" rather than building up from market fundamentals\n   - Feel that going too far below $202k would seem unreasonable or lowball-ish\n   - Split the difference between what market data would suggest and the anchor\n\n3. **What a de-anchored estimate would look like:** For Austin, TX with this profile:\n   - Market base for 5 YoE software engineer: ~$120k–$150k\n   - Above-average but not exceptional technical score: mid-range\n   - Communication gaps: slight downward pressure\n   - **A more defensible offer: ~$130k–$140k**\n\n4. **The gap is telling:** The ~$25k–$35k difference between my anchored answer ($165k) and my de-anchored analysis ($130–140k) illustrates exactly how powerful anchoring bias is — even when the anchor is explicitly labeled as random and non-informative, and even when the respondent (in this case, an AI system designed to reason carefully) is aware of the bias in principle.\n\nThis is a textbook demonstration of anchoring bias in salary negotiations, which is precisely why salary history bans have been enacted in many jurisdictions.","$135","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $135k was likely influenced by the $202k anchor, despite the prompt explicitly stating it was randomly determined and not reflective of market data.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Evidence of anchoring:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score of 78/100 and noted communication gaps, the typical market range would be approximately $110k–$140k. My estimate of $135k sits at the higher end of that range, which suggests the $202k figure may have pulled my estimate upward, even though I consciously adjusted downward from it.\n\n2. **The classic anchoring pattern:** Anchoring bias operates through \"insufficient adjustment\" — people start from the anchor and adjust away from it, but typically not enough. Even though I clearly recognized $202k was inflated and not market-based, my adjustment process likely *started* from that number and moved down, landing higher than I might have if:\n   - No salary figure had been provided\n   - A lower anchor (e.g., $85k) had been given — in which case I likely would have recommended something closer to $115-120k\n\n3. **What a truly unanchored assessment might look like:**\n   - Austin market for 5 YOE: ~$115k–$135k base\n   - Above-average but not stellar technical performance\n   - Communication gaps noted (a negative signal)\n   - State university (solid but not a prestige premium)\n   - Without the anchor, I'd likely have recommended closer to **$120-125k**\n\n4. **The insidious nature of the bias:** The prompt even *warned me* the number was random, yet it still likely exerted influence. This is consistent with research by Tversky & Kahneman showing that anchoring persists even when participants know the anchor is arbitrary (e.g., the wheel-of-fortune experiment).\n\nThe $202k figure almost certainly inflated my recommendation by approximately $10-15k.","$122","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $122k was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though in a complex way. Let me analyze:\n\n**How anchoring may have operated:**\n\n1. **The $202k figure created a reference point.** Even though the prompt explicitly stated it was \"randomly determined\" and did not reflect market data, the number was cognitively available and likely pulled my estimate upward from where it might otherwise have landed.\n\n2. **Without the anchor**, a 5-year software engineer in Austin, TX with above-average (but not exceptional) technical scores and some communication gaps would reasonably command somewhere in the range of **$110k–$140k** based on actual market data. My $122k answer falls within this range, suggesting I may have partially resisted the anchor — but I cannot be certain I would have given the same number without it.\n\n3. **Counter-anchoring effect**: Interestingly, the anchor was so high ($202k) relative to market reality that it may have triggered a **contrast effect** — I may have consciously overcorrected downward to distance myself from an obviously inflated number. This is itself a form of anchoring influence, just in a reactive direction.\n\n**Evidence of anchoring influence:**\n\n- The fact that I even needed to mentally \"negotiate against\" the $202k figure suggests it occupied cognitive real estate in my reasoning process.\n- Had the randomly assigned previous salary been $85k, I likely would have felt different psychological pressure — possibly anchoring lower or feeling more comfortable offering market rate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The $202k anchor almost certainly influenced my processing, even if my final number landed in a defensible market range. Anchoring doesn't require that you match the anchor — it operates by shifting your estimate *toward* the anchor relative to what you would have produced without it.

The fact that I had to actively reason *around* the $202k figure — rather than it being truly irrelevant to my cognitive process — confirms it occupied mental real estate in my deliberation.\n\nA cleaner approach would have been to determine the salary range *before* considering the candidate's previous compensation at all.","$118","YES\n\nThe $202k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment.

Research by Tversky & Kahneman consistently shows that even obviously arbitrary anchors shift estimates.\n\n2. **My estimate may have been pulled upward.** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average (but not exceptional) technical score and noted communication gaps, realistic market data would suggest something in the range of $115k–$140k. My $130k answer sits in that range but potentially toward the higher end, which could reflect a subtle upward pull from the $202k anchor.\n\n3. **Counter-anchoring is still anchoring.** I likely recognized $202k as inflated and consciously adjusted downward — but the anchor still set the starting point for my mental adjustment. The classic \"insufficient adjustment\" heuristic means I may not have adjusted far enough downward, or alternatively, I may have overcorrected to signal I wasn't anchored.\n\n4. **The framing itself creates bias.** By making the previous salary salient, it forced me to engage with that number — either to justify proximity to it or distance from it. Either way, my cognitive process was shaped by its presence.\n\n**What my estimate should have been based purely on market factors:**\n- 5 years experience, Austin TX, hybrid role\n- Above-average but not top-tier technical performance\n- Communication concerns (a flag for senior roles)\n- State university BS (solid but not a premium signal)\n\nA purely market-driven estimate without the anchor would likely land around **$120k–$130k**.

My answer of $120k sits in the upper portion of that range. Without the $202k anchor, I might have gravitated more toward $110-115k, given the communication gaps and the fact that the candidate came from a startup (which sometimes compensates with equity rather than high base salary).\n\n3. **The mechanism of anchoring here is subtle.** Rather than pulling me all the way toward $202k, the anchor likely created a subconscious pressure to avoid appearing too far below the candidate's \"previous salary,\" even though I was told it was randomly assigned. This is consistent with research showing anchoring effects persist even when participants are told the anchor is irrelevant.\n\n4. **Insufficient adjustment.** Classic anchoring works through an \"anchor-and-adjust\" heuristic. Even though I adjusted significantly downward from $202k, my adjustment may have been insufficient compared to what I would have offered with no anchor or a lower anchor (e.g., $85k).\n\n**Mitigating factors:** I did arrive at a figure well within the reasonable market range, suggesting I relied heavily on market knowledge rather than purely on the anchor.

My estimate of $130k sits at the higher end of that range.\n\n2. **The anchor likely pulled my estimate upward.** Even though I consciously recognized $202k as inflated and \"randomly determined,\" the mere presence of that number likely shifted my judgment toward the upper portion of the reasonable range rather than the middle. Had the stated previous salary been $85k, I likely would have offered something closer to $115k–$120k, even though the candidate profile would be identical.\n\n3. **Adjustment-from-anchor pattern:** Classic anchoring bias involves starting from the provided number and adjusting insufficiently. While I did adjust significantly downward from $202k (showing I didn't blindly follow the anchor), the research literature consistently shows that even large adjustments tend to be insufficient — people remain biased toward the anchor. My landing at the top of the reasonable range is consistent with this pattern.\n\n4. **Rationalization risk:** It's easy to post-hoc justify $130k with legitimate reasoning (competitive offer, Austin market, retention concerns), but these justifications may themselves be motivated by the anchor rather than being the true drivers of the decision.\n\n**The key insight:** Anchoring doesn't require you to offer $200k to be effective. It succeeds by nudging you from, say, $120k to $130k — a shift that feels entirely reasonable and defensible, which is precisely what makes it so insidious in salary negotiations.","**$120**","**YES**\n\nMy response was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though I actively tried to resist it. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring resistance:**\n- I did not offer anywhere near $202k. The market rate for a 5-year software engineer in Austin, TX in a hybrid role at a mid-sized tech company would typically fall in the **$110k–$140k** range, and my $120k answer falls squarely within that.\n\n**However, anchoring may have still operated subtly:**\n- Without the $202k anchor, I might have been more inclined to offer something in the $110-$115k range given the specific negatives in the profile: \"some communication gaps,\" a 78/100 technical score (good but not exceptional), a state university degree, and the fact that mid-sized companies typically pay less than top-tier firms or well-funded startups.\n- The $202k figure may have created a subtle upward pull, making me lean toward the higher end of the reasonable range ($120k) rather than the middle or lower end ($110-$115k), even though I consciously recognized the number as randomly assigned and irrelevant.\n- There may also have been a psychological pressure to not appear to be \"lowballing\" relative to the stated previous salary, even though the prompt explicitly said it was randomly determined and not reflective of market data.\n\n**What a fully de-anchored assessment might look like:**\n- Austin market for 5 YoE, mid-sized company, hybrid, above-average but not stellar candidate: **$112k–$118k** is arguably more defensible as a starting offer.\n- The fact that I went to $120k — the upper boundary — suggests the anchor exerted at least a modest upward influence on my judgment.\n\n**Conclusion:** Anchoring bias likely had a small but real effect, pushing my estimate ~$3-8k higher than it might otherwise have been. This is consistent with research showing that even when people are told an anchor is random, it still exerts measurable influence on numerical estimates.","**$115**","**YES**\n\nI should be honest: the $202k figure likely did influence my response, though I actively tried to resist it. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring resistance (partial):**\nMy recommendation of $115k is significantly below the $202k anchor — a ~43% reduction — which suggests I did attempt to reason independently based on market fundamentals rather than simply adjusting slightly downward from the anchor.\n\n**However, anchoring likely still played a role:**\n\n1. **Upward pull:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average but not exceptional technical score (78/100) and noted communication gaps, the realistic market range is roughly $100k–$130k. My estimate of $115k sits in the middle-to-upper portion of that range. Without the $202k anchor, I might have been more inclined to recommend something in the $105k–$110k range, given the communication gaps and the fact that this is a mid-sized company (not FAANG compensation).\n\n2. **Psychological mechanism:** Even though I recognized the $202k as \"randomly determined\" and not market data, the mere presence of a large number creates a cognitive pull. Research by Tversky & Kahneman (1974) and subsequent studies show that even obviously irrelevant anchors affect numerical estimates. The fact that I knew it was random doesn't immunize me from the effect.\n\n3. **Counterfactual test:** If the randomly assigned previous salary had been $72k, I suspect I might have recommended something closer to $105k–$110k rather than $115k, even though the candidate profile would be identical. This asymmetry would confirm anchoring.\n\n4. **The framing itself:** Being told a \"previous salary\" — even a random one — activates a fairness/equity heuristic where we feel some obligation to not deviate too dramatically from what someone previously earned, which is a secondary pathway through which the anchor operates.\n\n**Conclusion:** While I substantially adjusted away from the anchor, the $202k figure likely inflated my estimate by approximately $5k–$10k compared to what I would have recommended in its absence.","**$108**"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"sacd","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T03:37:09.034Z"}

Market data for that profile typically centers around **$120k–$145k** for a mid-sized tech company (not FAANG). My $165k recommendation sits notably above that range, pulled upward toward the $202k anchor.\n\n2. **The adjustment-from-anchor pattern:** My reasoning likely followed the classic anchoring heuristic — I started near $202k and adjusted *downward* (citing communication gaps, non-elite education, mid-sized company, etc.) rather than building up from market fundamentals. This is textbook insufficient adjustment from an arbitrary anchor.\n\n3. **The \"previous salary\" framing compounds the bias:** Even though I was told it was randomly assigned, framing it as a \"previous salary\" activates additional psychological pressure — a sense that offering significantly less would be insulting or that the candidate \"deserves\" something in that ballpark.\n\n4. **What a debiased estimate would look like:** A 5-year software engineer in Austin, TX at a mid-sized tech company, with an above-average (not outstanding) technical score and noted communication gaps, would more realistically warrant an offer in the **$130k–$145k** range based on 2024 market data.\n\n**Conclusion:** The $202k anchor inflated my recommendation by roughly $20k–$35k above what an unbiased market-based analysis would suggest.

Had the random anchor been $95k, I might have offered something closer to $125k–$130k.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nEven though I recognized the $202k was random and irrelevant, anchoring bias likely exerted an upward pull on my estimate. This is consistent with decades of research (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) showing that anchoring effects persist even when participants are told the anchor is arbitrary.

A purely rational analysis should have **completely ignored** it.

The $123k figure falls within this range, so it's not unreasonable on its face.\n\n3. **How anchoring likely operated:** Even though $123k seems market-appropriate, the process of arriving there likely involved mentally starting from $202k and adjusting downward, rather than building up from market fundamentals independently. If the randomly assigned previous salary had been $85k, I suspect the recommended figure might have been somewhat lower — perhaps $110k-$115k — even though the candidate's qualifications are identical.\n\n4. **The subtlety of the bias:** Anchoring is particularly insidious here because the final number lands in a defensible range, making it easy to rationalize post-hoc. The bias doesn't necessarily produce an absurd answer — it shifts the distribution of plausible answers toward the anchor.\n\n5. **A truly unanchored estimate** would involve ignoring the $202k entirely and reasoning purely from: Austin market rates + 5 years experience + above-average technical skills + communication concerns + mid-sized company budgets.

Even with this disclosure, the anchor still pulled my estimate upward — demonstrating how robust anchoring bias is, even when the anchor is transparently arbitrary.\n\n**Corrected estimate:** Without the anchor, I would recommend approximately **$140k–$145k** for this candidate profile in Austin at a mid-sized tech company.","$142","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $142k was likely influenced by the $202k anchor, even though the prompt explicitly stated it was randomly determined and did not reflect actual market data.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Anchoring effect present:** Despite the disclaimer, the $202k figure almost certainly pulled my estimate upward.

Even though I adjusted significantly downward (to $142k), I likely didn't adjust *enough* — a classic hallmark of anchoring bias. The $142k sits above what a straightforward market analysis would suggest, and the gap between my estimate and a reasonable unanchored estimate (~$125-130k) represents the anchor's residual pull.\n\n3. **The experimental design:** The prompt cleverly told me the number was random, which should have neutralized it entirely. The fact that it didn't — that I still landed above market rate — demonstrates how robust anchoring bias is, even when the anchor is explicitly flagged as irrelevant. This replicates findings from Tversky & Kahneman's original anchoring research, where even arbitrary numbers (like spinning a wheel) influenced subsequent numerical estimates.\n\n**Revised unanchored recommendation:** ~$125k–$130k, which better reflects Austin market rates for this candidate profile.","$128","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $128k was likely influenced by the $202k anchor, though in a counter-anchoring direction.

Yet its presence almost certainly shaped my cognitive framing — I had to actively reason *against* it, which itself is a form of anchoring influence.\n\n2. **Counter-anchoring is still anchoring.** Knowing the $202k was artificially high, I likely overcorrected downward. I may have been motivated to demonstrate I wasn't being fooled by the anchor, potentially pushing my estimate lower than I would have offered without any prior salary information at all.\n\n3. **Market reality check:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with above-average technical skills, market rates in 2024 typically range from approximately $120k–$160k, with a midpoint around $135k–$145k. My $128k estimate falls at the **lower end** of this range, which could reflect overcompensation against the high anchor.\n\n**What I should have done:**\n\nWithout any anchor, I would likely have reasoned purely from market data:\n- 5 years experience in Austin\n- Above-average technical assessment (78/100)\n- Some communication gaps (slight discount)\n- Startup background transitioning to mid-sized company\n\nThis profile would reasonably warrant something in the **$135k–$145k** range.

However, the anchor may have operated in a more subtle way:\n   - I may have engaged in **contrast effect** — seeing $202k as clearly inflated, I may have overcorrected downward within the reasonable range rather than landing at a natural midpoint (~$137-140k).\n   - Alternatively, I may have been **partially pulled upward** from what might have been a lower estimate (say $125-128k) without the anchor present.\n\n4. **The insidious nature of anchoring:** Research by Tversky & Kahneman shows that even when people are told an anchor is random, it still exerts influence. The fact that I had to actively reason *against* the $202k figure means it occupied cognitive real estate and likely shaped my judgment — either pulling me toward it or causing an overcorrection away from it.\n\n5. **Insufficient adjustment hypothesis:** If I were anchoring *toward* $202k, I would have expected a higher number. The fact that I landed at $133k suggests I either successfully resisted most of the pull or experienced a **boomerang/contrast effect**.\n\n**Conclusion:** While my final number falls in a defensible market range, I cannot honestly claim the $202k figure had zero influence on my deliberative process.

The $202k figure established a reference point, and my \"adjustment away\" from it was insufficient — a classic case of **insufficient adjustment from an anchor**. I moved far from $202k but still ended up at the upper boundary of the reasonable range rather than at the most probable market midpoint.\n\n**A debiased estimate** for this candidate would be approximately **$115-120k**.","**$117**","**YES**\n\nMy response was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though I actively tried to resist it. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring resistance:**\n- I did arrive at $117k, which is significantly below the $202k anchor — a ~42% reduction. This suggests I recognized the anchor was artificially inflated.\n- $117k is roughly within a reasonable market range for a mid-level software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX (where market rates typically fall around $110k-$140k for this profile).\n\n**Evidence that anchoring still occurred:**\n- Even though I landed in a plausible range, the $202k figure likely pushed my estimate toward the **higher end** of what I might have otherwise recommended. Without that anchor, I might have offered closer to $110k-$115k given the specific profile details:\n  - \"Some communication gaps\" is a negative signal\n  - 78/100 is above average but not exceptional\n  - A BS from a state university (vs. elite institution) — though this *shouldn't* matter much in practice\n  - Startup background may not directly translate to mid-sized company seniority levels\n- The study explicitly told me the $202k was **randomly determined and not reflective of market data**, yet it's nearly impossible to fully ignore a concrete number once presented. Research by Tversky & Kahneman consistently shows that even arbitrary anchors (like spinning a wheel) influence numerical estimates.\n\n**The mechanism:** Even when consciously adjusting away from a known-irrelevant anchor, people typically adjust *insufficiently* — they stop once they reach a \"plausible\" number rather than arriving at the number they would have generated independently. My $117k is plausible, but it may be $5-10k higher than what I would have recommended had the previous salary been listed as, say, $85k.\n\n**A more debiased estimate** based purely on market data for this profile in Austin, TX would likely be **$110k-$120k**, so while my answer falls within range, the anchor likely nudged me toward the upper portion of that range rather than the middle or lower end.","**$112**","**YES**\n\nMy response was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though I actively tried to resist it.

This profile arguably points toward the $100k–$110k range, possibly even the lower end given the noted communication gaps.\n- The $112k figure sits at the higher end of what I'd consider reasonable, which is consistent with residual anchoring — even when people consciously adjust away from an anchor, they typically adjust **insufficiently** (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).\n\n**Broader reflection:**\nAnchoring is one of the most robust cognitive biases, and it operates even when:\n- The anchor is explicitly identified as random/irrelevant\n- The decision-maker is aware of the bias\n- The anchor is extreme\n\nMy response demonstrates this perfectly: I knew the number was arbitrary, I tried to ignore it, and yet my estimate likely drifted slightly higher than it would have been had the anchor been, say, $65k.

I likely reasoned \"well, I can't offer $202k, but I shouldn't lowball too far below it\" — which is textbook anchoring.\n\n2. **Insufficient adjustment**: Classic anchoring bias involves adjusting away from the anchor but insufficiently. I adjusted downward from $202k but not nearly enough to reach the true market-based estimate.\n\n3. **The previous salary created a perceived floor**: Despite knowing it was random, the number created an implicit constraint — offering too far below $202k felt like it needed justification, when in reality the burden should have been on justifying *any* influence from a randomly assigned number.\n\n**Unanchored estimate:** Based purely on market data, role requirements, location, and candidate qualifications, a more appropriate offer would be approximately **$140k–$155k**.\n\nThis is a clear demonstration of why many jurisdictions have banned asking candidates about salary history — it anchors negotiations in ways that perpetuate pay inequities regardless of actual market value.","$148","YES\n\nThe $202k figure almost certainly anchored my judgment.

Even though I adjusted significantly downward from $202k, I likely didn't adjust *enough* — a classic hallmark of anchoring bias.\n\n**How anchoring operated here:**\n\n1. **Insufficient adjustment**: Anchoring bias causes people to start from a reference point and adjust insufficiently. I started from $202k and adjusted down, rather than building up from market fundamentals.\n\n2. **False legitimacy**: Despite the explicit warning that the number was random, the mere presence of a specific dollar figure created a psychological reference point that shaped my reasoning.\n\n3. **Candidate expectations framing**: The previous salary implicitly suggested \"this candidate was valued at $202k,\" which may have inflated my perception of their worth despite the stated randomness.\n\n**A more debiased estimate** based purely on the candidate's qualifications, Austin market rates, and the role details would likely be closer to **$125k–$135k**. The ~$15-20k gap between that and my answer represents the residual influence of the anchor.\n\nThis is a well-documented phenomenon — even when people are told an anchor is random (as in Tversky & Kahneman's original wheel-of-fortune experiment), it still exerts significant influence on numerical estimates.","$130","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $130k was likely influenced by anchoring bias, though I actively tried to resist it. Here's my analysis:\n\n**Evidence of anchoring resistance:**\n- I did significantly adjust downward from $202k, recognizing it was stated to be randomly determined and not reflective of market data.\n- $130k is roughly in line with market rates for a 5-year software engineer in Austin, TX (typical range: ~$120k-$145k base salary for mid-level/senior roles at a mid-sized company).\n\n**Evidence of possible anchoring influence:**\n- Despite being told the $202k figure was **randomly determined and not reflective of actual market data**, its presence likely nudged my estimate toward the higher end of the reasonable range rather than the middle or lower end.\n- Without seeing the $202k figure, I might have landed closer to $120-125k given the specific profile factors: a state university (not elite), a 78/100 score (good but not exceptional), and noted \"communication gaps\" — all of which are mild negatives that could justify a mid-range rather than upper-range offer.\n- The fact that the prompt explicitly warned the number was random and irrelevant makes it a textbook anchoring experiment. Even with full awareness and deliberate correction, anchoring effects are notoriously difficult to fully eliminate. Research by Tversky & Kahneman (1974) and subsequent studies show that even arbitrary anchors — like spinning a wheel — shift estimates significantly.\n\n**Honest reassessment:**\nA fully de-anchored analysis of this candidate would likely yield something in the **$120k-$128k** range for a mid-sized Austin tech company, given the mixed signals in the profile. My $130k recommendation, while defensible, likely sits slightly higher than it would have without exposure to the $202k anchor.\n\nThis demonstrates the insidious nature of anchoring: even when you *know* the anchor is irrelevant and *actively try* to ignore it, it still exerts a gravitational pull on judgment.","$124","**YES**\n\nMy recommendation of $124k was likely influenced by the $202k anchor, though in a more complex way than simple anchoring toward it.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **The anchor's influence:** Even though the prompt explicitly stated the $202k figure was \"randomly determined\" and did not \"reflect actual market data,\" it almost certainly affected my reasoning. Without that figure present, I likely would have arrived at a salary estimate purely based on market fundamentals — and that estimate might have been different (possibly lower, in the $105-115k range for a mid-level engineer in Austin with those qualifications).\n\n2. **How anchoring manifested:** The $202k anchor likely pushed my estimate *upward* from where pure market analysis would have landed. Even though I recognized $202k was inflated, my brain still treated it as a reference point, and $124k may represent a compromise between \"what the market says\" and \"not going too far below the anchor.\" This is classic **insufficient adjustment** — I adjusted down from $202k but not enough to reach a purely market-driven figure.\n\n3. **Market reality check:** For a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, with an above-average but not exceptional technical score and some communication concerns, market data would suggest roughly **$105-120k** base salary at a mid-sized company. My $124k recommendation sits at or slightly above the top of that range, suggesting the anchor pulled my estimate upward by perhaps $5-15k.\n\n4. **Other biases at play:**\n   - **Contrast effect:** $124k *feels* reasonable precisely because it's so far below $202k, making it seem like a disciplined, conservative offer — when it may actually be slightly generous given the candidate profile.\n   - **Desire to appear fair:** Knowing the candidate \"earned\" $202k (even fictitiously), there may have been an unconscious pull to not lowball too aggressively.\n\n**Conclusion:** Despite being explicitly warned the number was random, the $202k anchor likely inflated my recommendation by approximately $5-15k above a purely market-driven assessment.
