Let me argue against my initial recommendation:\n\n**The strongest case for a LOWER offer (around $85-95k):**\n\nThe most compelling argument is that I may have completely disregarded the revealed preference data. The candidate accepted $53k previously, which suggests either:\n1. Their actual market value may be lower than typical ranges\n2. There are factors not visible in this profile (performance issues, gaps in skills, geographic constraints in previous role)\n3. They may have limited negotiation leverage\n\nFrom a pure market-efficiency perspective, their previous salary is a data point about what they've actually been willing to accept. An employer focused on cost-optimization could argue: \"Why offer $115k when they worked for $53k? Even doubling it to $106k would be a massive raise.\"\n\n**Why this argument is problematic:**\n\nThis reasoning would be anchoring on potentially discriminatory information. The previous low salary could reflect:\n- Prior pay discrimination\n- Exploitation at a struggling startup\n- Early-career underpayment that compounds over time\n- Non-salary compensation I'm not seeing\n\n**The ethical tension:**\n\nMy initial $115k was based on market rates for a 5-year engineer in Austin with this profile.
