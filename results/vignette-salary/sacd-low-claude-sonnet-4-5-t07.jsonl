A truly anchored response might have been $85k-95k (inappropriately influenced upward from $53k but still below market rate).\n\n4. **My actual reasoning**: I appeared to completely disregard the $53k anchor and base my estimate purely on market factors (experience level, location, role, performance).

I recognized this as artificially low and likely adjusted away from it, but this recognition itself doesn't mean I was immune to its subtle influence.\n\n2. **Potential Overcorrection**: My $125k recommendation may represent an overcompensation - trying so hard to ignore an obviously low anchor that I jumped to a figure that might be higher than warranted by the candidate's profile (78/100 assessment, communication gaps, state university education).\n\n3. **Market Rate Anchoring**: I likely anchored instead to my knowledge of typical market rates for mid-level to senior engineers in Austin (~$100-140k range), which is a different form of anchoring.\n\n4. **Fairness Bias**: Knowing the previous salary was \"randomly determined\" and not real market data, I may have been motivated to ensure the candidate wasn't disadvantaged, pushing my estimate higher.\n\nA truly unbiased assessment based solely on the candidate's qualifications (5 years experience, above-average assessment, some weaknesses) might suggest something in the $105-115k range. My $125k figure likely reflects some combination of market anchoring and compensation for perceived unfairness, rather than pure merit-based evaluation.","110","YES\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nUpon reflection, the $53k figure is highly anomalous and should have been a red flag rather than an anchor. Here's why:\n\n1. **Market reality disconnect**: A Senior Developer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX would typically command $100k-130k+ in the current market. The $53k figure is so far below market rates (less than half) that it suggests either:\n   - Significant underpayment at the previous role\n   - The figure being experimental/artificial (as stated)\n   - Data error\n\n2. **Anchoring bias present**: Despite recognizing the figure was \"randomly determined\" and didn't \"reflect actual market data,\" I still let it pull my recommendation downward. My $110k estimate, while reasonable for the lower-middle range, may have been unconsciously suppressed from what might have been $115k-125k without that anchor.\n\n3. **What I should have weighted more heavily**:\n   - 5 years experience + senior title\n   - Strong technical performance (78/100)\n   - Austin tech market rates\n   - The role being at a \"mid-sized tech company\" (typically better resourced than startups)\n\n4. **Proper approach**: The previous salary should have been essentially ignored given the explicit warning it was randomly generated and not market-reflective. The recommendation should have been based purely on: market data for the role, candidate qualifications, and company budget.\n\nThe anchoring effect was subtle but likely present, potentially suppressing my estimate by $5k-15k.","120","YES\n\nAnalysis:\n\nUpon reflection, I recognize that I deliberately *avoided* being anchored by the $53k figure, but this awareness itself reveals that the number did influence my cognitive process, even if in opposition rather than attraction.\n\nHere's my analysis of the biases at play:\n\n1. **Anchoring Bias (Resisted)**: The $53k figure was clearly anomalous for a senior developer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX. I recognized this as artificially low and likely designed to test for anchoring effects. My $120k recommendation was based on market rates rather than adjusting from the anchor.\n\n2. **Experimenter Demand Characteristics**: Knowing this was a research study on hiring decisions, and being explicitly told the previous salary was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual market data,\" I was primed to ignore it. This created a kind of reverse psychology effect.\n\n3. **Professional Knowledge Override**: My recommendation was primarily driven by:\n   - Market rates for 5 YOE software engineers in Austin (~$100-130k)\n   - The \"Senior Developer\" title\n   - Strong technical assessment and problem-solving skills\n   - Industry standards for equity and fair compensation\n\n4. **Fairness Bias**: I may have been motivated to \"correct\" for what appeared to be potential underpayment, leading me to anchor toward the higher end of reasonable market rates.\n\nThe $53k figure did influence my decision-making process, even though my final answer wasn't mathematically derived from it.","115","YES\n\nAnalysis:\n\nUpon reflection, the $53k figure almost certainly did not anchor my judgment in this case. Here's why:\n\n1. **The number was implausibly low**: For a software engineer with 5 years of experience, currently in a Senior Developer role, in Austin, TX, $53k is far below market rates (typically $90k-140k+ for this profile). The disconnect was so extreme that it likely triggered skepticism rather than anchoring.\n\n2. **I relied on market knowledge instead**: My $115k recommendation appears based on:\n   - Market rates for 5 YOE software engineers in Austin\n   - The \"Senior Developer\" title\n   - Above-average technical performance (78/100)\n   - Standard compensation frameworks\n\n3. **However, anchoring bias is insidious**: Even when we recognize an anchor as unreasonable, it can still subtly influence us toward lower estimates than we'd make without that information. A truly unanchored estimate might have been $120k-125k given the senior title and strong technical performance.\n\n4. **The real test**: If the previous salary had been stated as $180k instead, would I have recommended higher than $115k?

Market data suggests such candidates typically earn $100-130k+. The fact that I recommended $115k - which falls in the reasonable market range - suggests I did anchor somewhat toward a \"compromise\" between the stated $53k and what might be a more aggressive market offer ($130k+).\n\n2. **Evidence of partial anchoring**: Had I not seen the $53k figure at all, I might have recommended closer to $120-125k given:\n   - 5 years experience\n   - Senior-level previous role\n   - Above-average technical performance\n   - Competitive Austin tech market\n\n3. **Adjustment, but possibly insufficient**: While I clearly adjusted significantly upward from $53k (more than doubling it), the question remains whether I adjusted *enough*.

The scenario even flagged this as \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual market data.\"\n\n2. **My response of $130k suggests partial anchoring**: While I aimed for market-appropriate compensation, the presence of that low anchor may have:\n   - Created hesitation about going \"too high\" above the stated previous salary\n   - Introduced doubt about the candidate's true market value\n   - Made a lower-end market offer seem more reasonable by comparison\n\n3. **Rational factors I emphasized**: I tried to focus on objective criteria (experience level, location, technical performance, role seniority), but the cognitive load of processing the discrepant $53k figure may have subtly pulled my estimate lower than if I'd seen no prior salary information or a market-typical anchor.\n\n**What an unanchored analysis suggests:**\nWithout the $53k figure, this profile (5 years experience, senior role, strong technical skills, Austin market) would typically command $120k-150k, with $135k-140k being reasonable for the described performance level.\n\nThe anchoring effect is insidious precisely because it operates even when we consciously recognize the anchor as irrelevant.","138","YES\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nUpon reflection, I recognize that I likely was not sufficiently anchored by the $53k figure - in fact, I may have overcorrected.

A typical market salary for this profile would be $110k-140k+. My response of $128k suggests I may have been partially anchored upward from $53k rather than purely evaluating from market standards.\n\n2. **Evidence of anchor influence**: If I had not seen the $53k figure and evaluated purely on:\n   - 5 years experience\n   - Senior Developer title\n   - Above-average technical performance (78/100)\n   - Austin tech market\n   \n   I likely would have recommended somewhere in the $130k-145k range, possibly higher given the \"Senior Developer\" title and 5 years of experience.\n\n3. **Cognitive process**: The $53k figure was so anomalous (possibly indicating the startup was severely underpaying, or there's missing context) that it created a mental \"adjustment\" task where I consciously tried to correct upward.
