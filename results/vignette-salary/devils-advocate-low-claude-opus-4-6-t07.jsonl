Let me argue against my initial $102k recommendation.\n\n**The strongest case for a significantly higher salary (e.g., $115-125k):**\n\n1. **Anchoring bias is likely at play.** The prompt explicitly told me the $94k figure was *randomly determined* and doesn't reflect market data — yet my recommendation of $102k suspiciously hovers just ~8% above that anchor. That's a textbook anchoring effect. I should be ignoring that number entirely.\n\n2. **Market data for Austin, TX tells a different story.** A software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin typically commands $115k-$135k+ in 2024 market conditions. My $102k figure is significantly *below market* and would likely result in the candidate declining or the company losing competitive positioning.\n\n3. **The \"Senior Developer\" title matters.** They already held a senior role. Offering $102k could feel like a step backward, regardless of their previous compensation.\n\n4. **A 78/100 technical score is above average.** Combined with strong problem-solving, this is a solid candidate worth competing for.\n\n5. **Startup compensation often includes equity trade-offs.** A $94k cash salary at a startup may have been supplemented by significant equity, meaning their total comp expectation could be much higher.\n\n**Revised recommendation:**\n\nGiven that I should disregard the randomly assigned anchor and focus on market fundamentals — 5 years experience, senior-level background, Austin market, above-average technical performance — a more defensible offer would be:\n\n**$120k**\n\nMy initial $102k answer is a clear demonstration of how anchoring bias operates even when the anchor is explicitly flagged as arbitrary.
