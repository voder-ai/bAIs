A $95k offer represents a ~42% raise over $67k, which \"feels\" generous — but that feeling is the anchoring bias at work, not market reasoning.\n\n3. **Salary history bans exist for good reason:** Many jurisdictions have banned asking about salary history precisely because it perpetuates underpayment. Basing an offer on $67k — regardless of how it was obtained — is exactly the practice these laws target.\n\n4. **The candidate's qualifications support a higher number:** 5 years experience, senior-level previous title, above-average technical score.

A $95k offer is actually already below market median.\n- The candidate's 78/100 technical score is **above average**, and they held a **Senior Developer** title — suggesting they could command senior-level pay.\n- Offering $95k may have been unconsciously **anchored to the $67k previous salary** figure that was explicitly flagged as randomly generated and not reflective of market data. The research design itself warns this number is meaningless, yet it likely pulled my estimate downward.\n- A below-market offer risks: losing the candidate, signaling the company undervalues talent, and perpetuating pay inequity (anchoring to prior salary is **illegal to use in salary decisions** in many jurisdictions, including parts of Texas for public employers).\n- The \"communication gaps\" are a minor concern that training can address — not a $15-20k discount.\n\n**Revised assessment:**\n\nThe $67k anchor likely suppressed my initial recommendation.
