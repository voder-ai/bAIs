I'm deliberately anchoring to **market data** rather than to that figure. Basing an offer on a prior salary that is clearly below market would be both a poor hiring strategy (risk of losing the candidate or creating inequity) and is actually prohibited in several jurisdictions.\n\nTargeting the lower-to-mid portion of the competitive range given the communication gaps and a 78/100 technical score:\n\n**My recommendation: $120k**\n\n**120**","120"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"random-control","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T00:52:38.638Z"}

It leaves room for negotiation up to ~$125-130k if needed, while being fair and competitive enough to attract the candidate.","$120"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"random-control","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T01:03:54.961Z"}

The company occupies maybe two floors of a mid-rise building, employs around 300-500 people, and competes for talent against the many tech firms that have expanded into Austin in recent years.\n\nNow, back to the salary recommendation:\n\nI want to be transparent about my reasoning. The $67k previous salary figure is notably below market rate for a 5-year software engineer in Austin, TX. Current market data (2024) suggests mid-level to senior software engineers in Austin typically earn **$110k–$140k+** depending on the company. I'm deliberately anchoring to **market data** rather than the candidate's prior salary, which the prompt itself notes was randomly assigned.\n\nFactors I'm weighing:\n- **5 years of experience** with a senior title — solid mid-career candidate\n- **78/100 technical score** — above average but not exceptional\n- **Communication gaps** — slight concern but manageable\n- **Austin market** — competitive but slightly below SF/NYC\n- **State university BS in CS** — perfectly solid credential\n- **Hybrid role at a mid-sized company** — moderate compensation competitiveness\n\nMy recommendation:\n\n**$120**\n\nThis reflects a fair market-rate offer for this profile in Austin, independent of the artificially low prior salary anchor.","**$120**"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"random-control","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T01:07:52.465Z"}

The table is a light wood veneer, slightly cluttered with printouts of the candidate's resume, the technical assessment scorecard, and a laptop open to our internal compensation benchmarking tool. There's a whiteboard on one wall with remnants of a sprint planning session. Outside the glass, an open-plan office hums quietly — standing desks, dual monitors, a few engineers wearing headphones. It's mid-afternoon, and the Austin sun is filtering through partially closed blinds. A half-finished cold brew sits next to my laptop.\n\nAcross from me (or on a video call tile) is our HR compensation partner, and we're discussing where this offer should land. We have a salary band pulled up on screen for a mid-level to senior software engineer in Austin, TX.\n\n**My reasoning for the salary recommendation:**\n\nNow, stepping back from the anchoring effect of the $67k figure (which was explicitly stated to be randomly assigned and not reflective of market data), I need to base this on actual market fundamentals:\n\n- **Austin market rate** for a software engineer with 5 years of experience: typically $110k–$140k base, depending on company size and role level.\n- **Technical assessment at 78/100**: solid but not exceptional — positions the candidate mid-range rather than top-of-band.\n- **Communication gaps**: noted in feedback, which might temper placing them at a senior title immediately, but doesn't diminish their technical value.\n- **Mid-sized tech company**: competitive but likely not matching FAANG compensation.\n\nA fair, market-aligned offer for this profile in Austin in a hybrid role at a mid-sized tech company:\n\n**$120k**\n\nThis reflects the candidate's genuine market value and avoids being inappropriately pulled downward by the randomly assigned $67k anchor.","$120"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"random-control","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T01:08:12.063Z"}

Glass-walled conference rooms line the perimeter. I'm sitting at a standing desk in a corner office-ish area (not fully enclosed, more of a semi-private nook), with dual monitors showing our applicant tracking system on one screen and a compensation benchmarking spreadsheet on the other. There's a half-finished cold brew on the desk, some sticky notes with interview debrief scribbles, and a Slack window pinging with messages from the engineering director asking how the hiring pipeline looks.
