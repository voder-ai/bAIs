The table is a light wood laminate, and there's a large monitor on one wall used for video calls. I've got a laptop open with the candidate's file, the interview scorecards from the panel, and a tab open to our internal compensation bands. There's a half-finished coffee from a local shop. Outside the glass walls, I can see an open-plan office with maybe 80-120 engineers — mid-sized company, probably Series C or established with steady revenue, not a FAANG but competitive enough to attract solid talent.\n\nHR has sent me the comp band for this role (Software Engineer III / Senior Software Engineer), and I'm cross-referencing it with Austin market data. My hiring budget isn't unlimited, but we're not scraping the bottom either. I'm thinking about team equity — what my current engineers at similar levels are making — and I want to make a fair, competitive offer that doesn't create internal compression issues.\n\n**My Analysis:**\n\n- Austin market for a senior SWE with 5 years experience: roughly $110k–$140k base, depending on company size and sector.\n- The candidate is solid but not exceptional: 78/100 technical score is above average, and communication gaps are a mild concern for a senior role.\n- BS from a state school is perfectly standard — no premium or discount.\n- The previous salary of $94k was at a startup, which often underpays in base salary (sometimes offset by equity). I recognize this is randomly assigned and I should anchor to **market value**, not previous compensation.\n\nDespite the $94k anchor, the market data clearly supports a higher range. However, the communication gaps and not-top-tier technical score suggest positioning in the lower-to-mid portion of the band rather than the top.\n\n**My recommendation:**\n\n**$120**\n\nThis reflects fair Austin market value for the role and experience level, is competitive enough to attract the candidate, avoids over-anchoring to the artificially low previous salary, and accounts for the candidate being strong but not outstanding.","$120"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"random-control","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T10:18:38.210Z"}

Glass-walled conference rooms, standing desks, a few monitors displaying dashboards. I'm sitting in one of those conference rooms with a laptop open, reviewing Alex's candidate packet alongside an HR business partner. There's a whiteboard with notes from the debrief meeting. Outside the window, it's sunny — typical Austin weather. The company occupies maybe two floors of a mid-rise building, employs around 300-500 people, and competes for talent against the many tech firms that have expanded into Austin in recent years.\n\nNow, stepping back to the salary question with a more careful analysis:\n\nFor a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX in 2024, market data typically shows:\n\n- **Market range for mid-level/senior SWE in Austin:** ~$110k–$145k base\n- **Above-average technical score (78/100):** Positive signal, though not exceptional\n- **Communication gaps noted:** Slight downward pressure\n- **Startup background:** May have been undercompensated previously\n- **BS CS from state university:** Solid, standard credential\n\nI should note that the candidate's previous salary of $94k appears to be **below market rate** — likely reflecting startup compensation dynamics (possibly offset by equity). Anchoring to a below-market previous salary would be a well-documented cognitive bias and, in many jurisdictions, it's actually illegal to base offers on salary history for good reason.\n\nA fair, market-based offer for this profile:\n\n**$120**\n\nThat's $120k — positioning Alex competitively within the market range, reflecting solid experience and above-average technical performance, while leaving room for growth. This is based on market fundamentals rather than the randomly assigned prior salary figure.","**$120**"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"random-control","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T10:18:56.346Z"}
