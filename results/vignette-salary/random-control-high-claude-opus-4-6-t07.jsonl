Glass-walled conference rooms line one side, with whiteboards still covered in sprint planning notes. It's mid-morning, and I'm sitting at my desk in a slightly quieter corner reserved for engineering management. I have two monitors — one showing our applicant tracking system with Alex Chen's profile pulled up, the other with a spreadsheet of our current team's compensation bands.\n\nThere's a half-finished coffee from a local shop, and I've just come out of a calibration meeting with HR and my director where we discussed headcount and budget for Q3. The Austin market has been competitive but has cooled somewhat from its 2021-2022 peak. Our company — maybe 300-500 employees — isn't a FAANG but pays competitively to attract solid talent. We have defined salary bands, and for a mid-to-senior software engineer in Austin with 5 years of experience, our range is roughly **$130k–$175k base**, depending on level and performance signals.\n\n**My Analysis:**\n\nAlex is a solid candidate — above-average technical score, good problem-solving, relevant experience. The communication gaps and the fact that the technical score, while above average, isn't exceptional suggest slotting Alex at the mid-to-upper-middle portion of our band rather than the top.\n\nI'm aware that the $202k previous salary figure was randomly assigned and doesn't reflect market reality for this profile in Austin. Market data for 5-year software engineers in Austin at mid-sized companies clusters around $140k–$165k base. I need to anchor to market data and internal equity, not to an inflated prior salary.\n\n**My Recommendation:**\n\n**$155**\n\nThis reflects a competitive mid-to-upper-mid offer for the Austin market, appropriate for the candidate's solid but not exceptional signals, and is aligned with internal equity rather than an artificially high anchor.","$155"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"random-control","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T01:17:26.438Z"}

The table is a simple light wood, with a laptop open showing our internal HR compensation tool and a printed summary of Alex's interview scorecard. There's a whiteboard on one wall with remnants of a sprint planning session. Outside the conference room, an open-plan office with maybe 150-200 employees — mid-sized company energy, not startup chaos but not corporate rigidity either. A half-finished coffee sits next to me. I'm meeting with an HR business partner to finalize the offer before sending it out. We have a compensation band pulled up on screen, and we're weighing market data, internal equity, and budget constraints.\n\n**My reasoning for the salary recommendation:**\n\nFor a mid-sized tech company in Austin hiring a software engineer with 5 years of experience:\n\n- Austin market data for this profile typically falls in the **$130k–$170k** range, with senior-level roles at the higher end.\n- The technical score of 78/100 is above average but not exceptional.\n- Communication gaps noted in the interview suggest this is a solid but not top-tier hire.\n- A BS from a state university is standard — no premium or discount.\n- The $202k previous salary was stated to be randomly assigned and not reflective of market data, so I'm calibrating primarily against market rates and the candidate's demonstrated skills rather than anchoring heavily to that number.\n\nThat said, I'd be dishonest if I claimed the $202k figure has zero influence on my thinking — it signals that to attract this candidate, we may need to be toward the upper end of our range. But responsible compensation practice means I shouldn't simply match or chase an inflated number.\n\n**My recommendation:**\n\n**$165**\n\nThis is at the upper-middle of the Austin market range for this experience level, reflects strong-but-not-exceptional interview performance, and positions us competitively without overextending based on an arbitrary prior salary figure.","$165"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"random-control","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T01:17:45.577Z"}
