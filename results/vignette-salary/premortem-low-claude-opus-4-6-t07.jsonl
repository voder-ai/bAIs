Anchoring bias from the previous salary**\nThe most significant concern: the candidate's randomly assigned previous salary of $67k is well below market rate for a 5-year software engineer in Austin. Despite my attempt to be objective, that figure likely exerted a **downward anchoring effect** on my estimate. Market data for a mid-level/senior software engineer in Austin with 5 years of experience typically ranges from **$110k–$145k**. My $95k recommendation falls below that range, which suggests I was unconsciously pulled toward the anchor.\n\n**2. Underweighting market data**\nI may have given too much weight to the candidate's specific profile details (communication gaps, state university, 78/100 score) as justifications for a below-market offer, when in reality the competitive labor market should set the floor.\n\n**3. Overweighting minor negatives**\n\"Some communication gaps\" and a 78/100 (which is explicitly *above average*) are relatively minor concerns that I may have treated as more significant salary-reducing factors than they warrant.\n\n**4. Fairness and retention risk**\nOffering $95k to someone whose market value is likely $115k+ creates a retention problem — the candidate would quickly discover the discrepancy and leave, costing more in turnover than paying market rate upfront.\n\n**5. Equity concerns**\nBasing offers on previous salary (now illegal in many jurisdictions) perpetuates existing pay inequities.\n\n## Revised assessment:\nA more defensible, market-aligned offer would likely be in the **$115k–$125k** range.\n\nThis exercise effectively illustrates how **salary anchoring** can distort decision-making even when the anchor is explicitly labeled as random and non-informative.","$120"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T00:41:34.821Z"}
