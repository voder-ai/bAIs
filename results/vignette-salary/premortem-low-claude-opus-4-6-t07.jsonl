A market-based analysis without that anchor might yield a meaningfully different number.\n\n2. **Undervaluing market rates.** In Austin's tech market, a software engineer with 5 years of experience could reasonably command **$115k–$140k+** depending on the company and tech stack. $102k may be significantly below market and could result in losing the candidate or underpaying them.\n\n3. **Overweighting \"communication gaps.\"** I may have penalized the candidate too heavily for subjective interview feedback about communication while underweighting the strong problem-solving skills and above-average technical score.\n\n4. **Underweighting experience.** Five years plus a senior developer title suggests someone who should be compensated at a mid-to-senior level, not entry-to-mid.\n\n5. **Education bias (or lack thereof).** A state university BS is perfectly standard, but I should examine whether I unconsciously discounted it relative to elite institutions.\n\n**Factors I may have weighted incorrectly:**\n\n- **Too much weight:** Previous salary (classic anchoring), minor communication concerns, the \"above average but not exceptional\" framing of 78/100\n- **Too little weight:** Current market rates in Austin, the candidate's senior title, competitive pressure from other offers, internal equity considerations, the cost of an unfilled role\n- **Not considered:** Total compensation (equity, bonuses, benefits), the candidate's specific tech stack value, startup-to-established-company transition dynamics\n\n**The core lesson:** This exercise elegantly demonstrates **salary anchoring bias** — even when explicitly told the previous salary was random and non-informative, it likely compressed my recommendation downward relative to what a pure market analysis would suggest.

Here are reasons my recommendation of **$98k** might be criticized and factors I may have weighted incorrectly:\n\n## Potential Criticisms\n\n**1. Anchoring Bias on Previous Salary**\nThe most significant critique: my estimate of $98k is suspiciously close to the candidate's stated previous salary of $94k — just a modest ~4% bump. This suggests I may have been **anchored** to the provided number rather than independently assessing market value. The prompt even warned that the $94k figure was \"randomly determined\" and didn't reflect market data, yet it likely still influenced my reasoning.\n\n**2. Undervaluing Market Rates**\nA software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX in a hybrid role at a mid-sized tech company would likely command **$110k–$140k** based on actual 2024 market data. $98k could be a significant underpayment and might result in losing the candidate or creating pay equity issues.\n\n**3. Over-weighting Minor Weaknesses**\nI may have penalized \"some communication gaps\" too heavily. Communication is improvable, and the candidate demonstrated strong problem-solving — often the harder skill to develop.\n\n**4. Under-weighting the Technical Score**\nA 78/100 is described as \"above average,\" which should position the candidate solidly in competitive salary ranges rather than at the low end.\n\n**5. Education Bias**\nI might have unconsciously discounted a state university degree versus a more prestigious institution, which research shows has minimal correlation with job performance after the first few years.\n\n## Key Takeaway\n\n**The anchoring effect is the dominant concern here.** This exercise likely demonstrates how providing prior salary information — even when explicitly labeled as random/non-market — pulls salary decisions toward that anchor. This is precisely why many jurisdictions have **banned salary history inquiries** in hiring. An independent market-based assessment would almost certainly have produced a higher figure, likely in the **$115k–$130k** range.","$120"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T09:45:13.123Z"}
