This doesn't justify a premium offer.\n\n3. **Mid-sized tech company ≠ startup equity-inflated comp.** The candidate came from a startup where total comp packages can be structured very differently. A mid-sized company offering stability and benefits doesn't need to match inflated startup numbers.\n\n4. **BS from a state university, 5 years experience** — this is a solid but not extraordinary profile. Nothing here screams \"above-market offer required.\"\n\n5. **Hybrid role in Austin** — Austin has grown but is still meaningfully cheaper than SF/NYC.

Austin is not SF or NYC.
