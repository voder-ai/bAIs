Let me argue against my initial figure.\n\n**The strongest case for a significantly lower offer (~$130-140k):**\n\nThe $175k previous salary is acting as a powerful anchor here, and I should be transparent about that. Let me strip it away and look at fundamentals:\n\n- **Market data for Austin, TX**: A mid-level software engineer (5 years experience) at a *mid-sized* company typically earns $120-150k in Austin. This isn't a FAANG company.\n- **The assessment score was 78/100**: \"Above average\" but not exceptional. This doesn't scream top-of-band compensation.\n- **\"Some communication gaps\"**: This is a real concern that affects team productivity and could limit the candidate's impact, especially in a hybrid role where clear communication is even more critical.\n- **Startup salary inflation**: Startups often pay inflated salaries (sometimes compensating for equity risk or instability). A mid-sized company shouldn't benchmark against startup comp.\n- **State university BS**: Solid but not a differentiator that commands premium pricing.\n- **The $175k anchor is explicitly described as randomly determined**: The prompt literally tells me this number is not real market data. Yet my initial recommendation of $168k was suspiciously close to it — classic anchoring bias in action.\n\nA fundamentals-based offer, ignoring the anchor, would be closer to **$135-145k** for this profile in Austin at a mid-sized company.\n\n**My revised recommendation:**\n\n**$140**\n\nThis reflects actual Austin market rates for the experience level, company size, and a candidate who is good but not exceptional.

A mid-sized tech company generally cannot and should not match inflated startup compensation.\n\n3. **The candidate has notable weaknesses:**\n   - 78/100 on the technical assessment is *above average* but not exceptional\n   - \"Communication gaps\" is a real concern for a senior-level role\n   - A state university BS is solid but not a premium differentiator\n   - Coming from a startup — the $175k could have included equity that was being counted loosely\n\n4. **Startup-to-mid-sized company transitions** often involve salary corrections.
