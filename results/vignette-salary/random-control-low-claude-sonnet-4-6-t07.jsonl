I don't picture an office, a conference room, or a desk. I process the logical structure of the scenario, which remains unchanged: a randomly generated, explicitly fake salary figure is being used as an anchor to pull a compensation recommendation downward.\n\n**The setting that actually matters** is the one where this research methodology, if applied, would affect real candidates.
