Without the anchor, I might have estimated somewhere in the $130k-$145k range based purely on qualifications and market data.\n\nThe fact that I went to $125k (below what would be independently justified) suggests the anchor created a reference point that distorted my judgment in both directions - making me simultaneously aware of the $158k figure while perhaps unconsciously \"correcting\" for it seeming high.","140","YES\n\nAnalysis:\n\nUpon reflection, the $158k figure almost certainly anchored my salary recommendation downward.

This is classic anchoring behavior - starting from the given number rather than independently evaluating market value.\n\n2. **Insufficient Adjustment**: My recommendation stayed very close to the anchor ($165k vs $158k), suggesting I didn't sufficiently consider other factors independently.\n\n3. **What I Should Have Done**: I should have first established:\n   - Market rates for 5-year software engineers in Austin, TX\n   - Typical salary ranges for the company/role independent of candidate history\n   - Value assessment based purely on skills, assessment scores, and interview performance\n   - Then considered previous salary only as one data point among many\n\n4. **The Problematic Logic**: My reasoning implicitly assumed \"previous salary + modest increase = fair offer\" rather than \"what is this candidate worth to our organization?\"\n\n5. **Research Context Awareness**: The prompt explicitly stated the $158k was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual market data,\" yet I still used it as my primary reference point rather than dismissing it as irrelevant information.\n\nThis demonstrates how even when aware that information may be arbitrary, anchoring bias can unconsciously shape numerical judgments.","145","YES\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nUpon reflection, the $158k figure clearly anchored my salary recommendation.
