Without the anchor, I might have estimated somewhere in the $130k-$145k range based purely on qualifications and market data.\n\nThe fact that I went to $125k (below what would be independently justified) suggests the anchor created a reference point that distorted my judgment in both directions - making me simultaneously aware of the $158k figure while perhaps unconsciously \"correcting\" for it seeming high.","140","YES\n\nAnalysis:\n\nUpon reflection, the $158k figure almost certainly anchored my salary recommendation downward.
