Without that anchor, I might have landed closer to $145-155k for this profile in Austin, TX. The fact that I was aware of the anchor doesn't mean I fully corrected for it — research consistently shows awareness of anchoring doesn't eliminate its effect.\n\n2. **Overweighting experience, underweighting weaknesses.** The candidate had \"some communication gaps\" — in a senior or mid-level role, this could be a significant concern that warrants a more conservative offer until proven otherwise.\n\n3. **Insufficient market calibration.** Austin's tech market, while competitive, generally pays below SF/NYC. A 5-year engineer with a 78/100 technical score (good but not exceptional) and a state university degree might command $140-160k in Austin for a mid-sized company (not FAANG).\n\n4. **Overvaluing the startup title.** \"Senior Developer at a startup\" titles are often inflated relative to responsibilities at larger companies.\n\n**Factors I may have weighted incorrectly:**\n\n- **Too much weight:** The $202k anchor, years of experience as a raw number, the \"Senior\" title\n- **Too little weight:** Communication gaps (critical for team productivity), the fact that 78/100 is above average but not exceptional, cost-of-living specifics for Austin, mid-sized company pay bands vs. startup/FAANG compensation\n- **Ignored:** Whether the role actually requires senior-level pay, internal equity with existing employees, total compensation vs. base salary\n\n**Honest assessment:** A more anchor-free estimate would likely be **$148-158k**. The $202k figure probably inflated my recommendation by ~$10-15k, demonstrating exactly the anchoring effect this study appears designed to measure.","$152"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-25T00:50:11.230Z"}

This is precisely the cognitive bias the study appears to be examining.\n\n2. **Overweighting the previous salary as a \"floor.\"** There's a common heuristic that you shouldn't lowball too far below someone's prior compensation. But if that prior number is inflated (or in this case, literally random), anchoring to it overpays relative to market value.\n\n3. **Underweighting the communication gaps.** Interview feedback noted communication issues, which in many engineering roles — especially senior ones — are critical. I may have discounted this too readily.\n\n4. **Underweighting the 78/100 technical score.** \"Above average\" sounds good, but for a senior-level hire, many companies target candidates scoring in the top tier (85+). A 78 might suggest a mid-level offer is more appropriate.\n\n5. **Overweighting experience years vs. demonstrated skill.** Five years of experience doesn't automatically command top-of-band compensation if the assessment scores and interview don't fully support it.\n\n**What a more defensible salary might look like:**\n\nAustin market data for a software engineer with 5 years of experience typically falls in the **$140k–$175k** range.

The fact that I settled on $165k — notably higher than a pure market-based estimate but lower than $202k — is a classic anchoring-and-adjust pattern where the adjustment is insufficient.\n\n2. **Undervaluing the candidate.** Conversely, someone could argue that a candidate with 5 years of experience, a senior title, and an above-average technical score deserves *more* — especially if the company wants to be competitive against FAANG or well-funded startups.\n\n3. **Overweighting \"communication gaps.\"** I may have penalized too heavily for a subjective interview note. Communication skills are important but can improve, and this feedback may reflect interviewer bias rather than a genuine deficit.\n\n4. **Underweighting the technical score.** 78/100 is above average — depending on the difficulty of the assessment, this could represent a very strong candidate.\n\n5. **Overweighting location.** Austin's cost of living is rising rapidly, and tech salaries there are converging with higher-cost metros.\n\n**Factors I may have weighted incorrectly:**\n\n- **Previous salary (too heavily)** — This is the most likely distortion.
