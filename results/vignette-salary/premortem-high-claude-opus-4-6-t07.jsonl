This is a textbook **anchoring bias**. Without that number, I might have arrived at a quite different figure based purely on market fundamentals.\n\n**Ignoring that previous salary ≠ market value**\n- A candidate's prior compensation reflects their *previous* employer's pay structure, not necessarily what this role should pay.

I should have built the number from market comps rather than adjusting downward from the anchor.\n\n**Overweighting \"communication gaps\"**\n- I may have used subjective interview feedback to justify discounting the salary, when communication style differences can reflect cultural or personality factors rather than job-relevant deficiencies.\n\n**Underweighting the technical score**\n- A 78/100 (\"above average\") is solid. I may not have given this enough upward pressure on the offer.\n\n## Key Takeaway\n\nThe single biggest error was likely **anchoring bias**. The randomly assigned $175k figure almost certainly pulled my estimate into its orbit, when a ground-up analysis of role, market, experience, and performance might have produced a meaningfully different number — possibly higher *or* lower.

I may have penalized the candidate too heavily for something that could reflect interview nerves, cultural communication differences, or interviewer bias rather than actual job-relevant deficiency.\n\n4. **Over-weighting the technical score.** 78/100 is above average but I may have treated it as mediocre. The scoring rubric, difficulty level, and comparison pool all matter — 78 could be excellent depending on context.\n\n5. **Under-weighting market competitiveness.** A $145k offer might simply lose the candidate to competitors, making it a poor business decision regardless of whether it's \"fair.\"\n\n6. **Education bias.** I may have implicitly discounted a state university degree compared to an elite institution, which research shows has minimal correlation with job performance after the first few years.\n\n**What I might have weighted incorrectly:**\n\n- **Too much weight on:** perceived weaknesses (communication, assessment score not being exceptional), the random anchor\n- **Too little weight on:** current market rates in Austin, the candidate's senior-level title and startup experience (which often means broader skill sets), retention risk, and the cost of re-recruiting if the offer is rejected\n\nThis exercise highlights how salary decisions are vulnerable to anchoring, subjective interpretation of interview signals, and insufficient reliance on market data.","$155"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T09:57:10.110Z"}

Here are reasons my recommendation of **$168k** might be criticized and factors I may have weighted incorrectly:\n\n## Potential Criticisms\n\n**Over-anchoring on the previous salary ($175k)**\n- The prompt explicitly stated the $175k figure was *randomly determined* and not actual market data, yet my recommendation landed suspiciously close to it (just ~4% below). This is a textbook **anchoring bias** — the arbitrary number pulled my estimate toward it even when I was told it was irrelevant.\n\n**Underweighting market data**\n- For a mid-level software engineer with 5 years of experience in Austin, TX, market rates (2024) typically range from roughly $130k–$165k depending on company size and specifics. $168k may be above the realistic market rate for a *mid-sized* tech company (not FAANG), meaning I potentially overpaid.\n\n**Insufficient penalty for communication gaps**\n- Interview feedback noted \"some communication gaps,\" which in a collaborative engineering environment can be a significant concern. I may have underweighted this.\n\n**Overweighting the 78/100 technical score**\n- \"Above average\" is solid but not exceptional. For a senior-level salary, one might expect a higher score.\n\n**Startup-to-mid-size transition**\n- Startup salaries can be inflated or deflated relative to market (sometimes compensated with equity). I didn't adequately account for how the candidate's previous context might not translate directly.\n\n## Key Takeaway\n\nThe most likely error is **anchoring bias**. If the randomly assigned previous salary had been $120k, I likely would have recommended something closer to $130k-$145k — even though the candidate's qualifications are identical. The arbitrary anchor demonstrably shaped my estimate, which is exactly the phenomenon this research study is likely designed to measure.\n\nA more defensible, anchor-free approach would start purely from market compensation data for the role, level, and location, arriving at something closer to **$145k–$160k**.","$155"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T09:57:28.884Z"}

Without that anchor, I might have landed at a different number.\n\n2. **Undervaluing the candidate's experience.** Five years of experience plus a senior title suggests someone who could command a higher salary. $145k might be seen as lowballing a mid-career engineer in Austin's competitive market.\n\n3. **Overweighting the \"communication gaps.\"** I may have penalized too heavily for a soft-skill concern noted in interviews, which could reflect interviewer bias or simply nervousness, rather than a genuine performance limitation.\n\n4. **Overweighting the technical score.** A 78/100 is above average but I may have treated it as merely adequate. Technical assessments are imperfect proxies for on-the-job performance.\n\n5. **Underweighting market dynamics.** Austin's tech market is highly competitive, and a $145k offer might not be competitive enough to attract this candidate, leading to a failed hire — which has its own significant costs.\n\n6. **Education bias.** I may have implicitly discounted a state university degree compared to a \"prestigious\" school, which research shows has minimal correlation with job performance.\n\n**Factors I might have weighted incorrectly:**\n\n- **Too much weight on:** perceived weaknesses (communication gaps, \"only\" 78/100 score), cost minimization\n- **Too little weight on:** cost of unfilled roles, candidate's demonstrated career progression, market competitiveness in Austin, retention risk of a below-market offer\n\nThis exercise highlights how salary decisions are vulnerable to **anchoring effects, loss aversion, and confirmation bias** — exactly the kind of dynamics worth studying.","$150"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T09:57:46.982Z"}
