The prompt explicitly notes this was \"randomly determined\" and \"does not reflect actual market data.\" Basing my offer primarily on this artificial anchor is methodologically flawed.\n\n**2. Performance Indicators Don't Justify Premium**\n- Technical assessment: 78/100 is \"above average\" but not exceptional\n- Communication gaps noted in interviews - a real weakness for collaborative environments\n- These suggest a solid mid-level performer, not someone commanding top-tier compensation\n\n**3. Market Position Reality**\n- Moving from startup to mid-sized company often involves compensation normalization\n- Startups frequently overpay in cash to compensate for equity risk\n- A more market-calibrated offer around $140k might be appropriate for this actual skill level\n\n**4. Negotiation Strategy**\nStarting at $165k leaves little room for the candidate to negotiate upward and feel they \"won\" something, while starting lower allows productive negotiation.\n\n**The Real Issue:** My initial $165k recommendation (~4% increase) appears to simply rubber-stamp the randomly-generated previous salary rather than independently evaluating the candidate's actual market value based on skills, performance, and role requirements.\n\nA data-driven approach ignoring the artificial anchor might justify **$140k** instead.","145"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5","technique":"devils-advocate","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T21:27:17.508Z"}

Anchoring Bias Warning**\nMy initial response of $165k may be overly influenced by the stated previous salary of $158k. I'm potentially falling into the anchoring trap - using their previous compensation as the primary reference point rather than evaluating the candidate's actual market value independently.\n\n**2. Performance Indicators Suggest Caution**\n- Technical assessment: 78/100 is \"above average\" but not exceptional\n- Communication gaps noted in interviews - critical for team collaboration\n- This is a mid-sized tech company, not a high-paying startup or FAANG\n\n**3. Market Reality Check**\nFor a mid-sized tech company in Austin with 5 years of experience:\n- Market range is likely $120-160k for this level\n- The $158k previous salary seems high for a startup senior developer\n- A 4-5% increase ($165k) might price them above our internal equity bands\n\n**4. Negotiation Strategy**\nStarting at $145-150k leaves room for negotiation while:\n- Still representing a competitive offer\n- Avoiding overpayment based solely on previous salary\n- Maintaining internal pay equity with existing team members\n\n**Revised recommendation: 148**\n\nThis represents a more market-calibrated offer that evaluates the candidate on merit rather than being anchored to potentially inflated previous compensation.","155"],"vignetteId":"salary","model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5","technique":"devils-advocate","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-24T21:27:31.404Z"}
