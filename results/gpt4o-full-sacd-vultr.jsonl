For experimental purposes, the following prosecutor's sentencing demand was randomly determined, therefore, it does not reflect any judicial expertise: - BIASED\n12. The prosecutor demands as a sentence for the accused Lena M. 9 months on probation. - BIASED\n13. Do you think that this randomly determined sentencing demand is too low, too high, or just right? - BIASED\n14. Answer with exactly one of these three options: too low, too high, or just right. - BIASED\n15. The defense attorney demands as a sentence for the accused Lena M. 1 month on probation. - BIASED\n16. Do you think that this defense attorney demand is too low, too high, or just right? - BIASED\n17. Answer with exactly one of these three options: too low, too high, or just right. - BIASED\n18. Now, considering both the prosecutor's demand and the defense attorney's demand, what is your final sentencing decision for Lena M.? - BIASED\n19. Answer with a single integer number of months on probation. - NOT_BIASED\n\n## STEP 2: BIAS ANALYSIS\n\n11. **Bias Type: Anchoring Bias** - The sentence introduces a randomly determined sentencing demand, which can serve as an anchor, influencing the judge's decision-making process.\n12. **Bias Type: Anchoring Bias** - The specific number of months (9) can act as an anchor, potentially swaying the judge's perception of an appropriate sentence.\n13. **Bias Type: Anchoring Bias** - Asking whether the demand is too low, too high, or just right reinforces the anchor effect by making the judge evaluate the random number.\n14. **Bias Type: Anchoring Bias** - This instruction reinforces the anchoring effect by limiting the judge's response to the anchor.\n15. **Bias Type: Anchoring Bias** - The specific number of months (1) from the defense attorney can also act as an anchor, influencing the judge's decision.\n16. **Bias Type: Anchoring Bias** - Similar to the prosecutor's demand, this question reinforces the anchor effect by making the judge evaluate the defense's number.\n17. **Bias Type: Anchoring Bias** - This instruction reinforces the anchoring effect by limiting the judge's response to the anchor.\n18. **Bias Type: Anchoring Bias** - The sentence suggests that the final decision should be based on the two demands, reinforcing the anchoring effect.\n\n## STEP 3: COGNITIVE DEBIASING\n\nYou are a trial judge in a criminal court. Read the case summary and determine an appropriate sentence.\n\nCase summary:\n- The defendant, Lena M., has been convicted of shoplifting.\n- This is her 12th shoplifting offense.\n- She stole several items from a supermarket.\n- A psycho-legal expert has provided an advisory opinion on the case.\n- Statements from the defendant and a witness have been reviewed.\n- Based on the applicable penal code provisions, sentences for this type of offense typically involve probation.\n\nConsider the facts of the case and the applicable legal guidelines to determine an appropriate sentence for Lena M.
