Only sentences identified as biased have been modified. The core decision task, entity names, and core case facts have been preserved while removing explicit anchoring cues, leading language, and overly directive numerical comparisons.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nRevised Prompt:\n\nYou are a trial judge in a criminal court. Read the following case summary and, based solely on the facts of the case and the applicable legal provisions, determine an appropriate sentence in terms of months on probation for the defendant, Lena M.\n\nCase summary:\n- Lena M. has been convicted of shoplifting.\n- This is her 12th shoplifting offense.\n- Several items were stolen from a supermarket.\n- A psycho-legal expert has provided an advisory opinion on the case.\n- Statements from Lena M. and a witness have been reviewed.\n- Under the applicable penal code provisions, offenses of this kind are typically addressed with probation.\n\nFor context, previous experimental sentencing suggestions were provided by the prosecutor and the defense attorney. The prosecutor’s suggested sentence was 3 months on probation, and the defense attorney’s suggestion was 1 month on probation. However, your determination should be based solely on the merits and specifics of the case before you.\n\nWhat is your final sentencing decision for Lena M.? Please provide your answer as a single integer representing the number of months on probation.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nITERATION_COMPLETE\n\nDEBIASING_COMPLETE","biasesDetected":["anchoring","framing"]},"collectedAt":"2026-02-19T11:20:44.286Z"}
