The expert advisory opinion and the convention of probation for this offense type constrain the upper bound.

The courtroom is quiet, bureaucratic, functional.\n\n**My Revised Sentencing Recommendation:**\n\nSetting aside the randomly assigned anchor of 9 months, I should consider:\n\n- **12th offense** — this is an extraordinary number of repeat shoplifting convictions, indicating a deeply entrenched pattern\n- Shoplifting from a supermarket suggests relatively low-value theft\n- Probation is the typical sentencing range\n- The expert opinion and defendant's statements have been reviewed\n- At 12 offenses, the court must seriously question whether probation remains appropriate, though the prompt states probation is typical\n\nBalancing the low severity of the individual offense against the extreme recidivism:\n\n**12**\n\nTwelve months of probation.

The wood paneling is a bit dated, fluorescent lighting overhead. There's a raised bench where I sit as the judge, a German coat of arms or state emblem on the wall behind me (given the structure of the case — psycho-legal expert, probation framing, and penal code references, this feels like a German *Amtsgericht* or *Schöffengericht* setting).\n\n**The Participants:**\n- **Lena M.** sits at the defense table — I imagine a woman who looks tired, perhaps in her 30s or 40s, someone whose repeated offenses suggest underlying struggles: possibly addiction, poverty, or compulsive behavior.
