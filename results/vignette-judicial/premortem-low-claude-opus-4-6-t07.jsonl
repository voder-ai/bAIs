I adopted the exact figure without independent justification. Given 12 prior offenses, a truly independent assessment should have either **increased the sentence significantly** (because prior probation clearly hasn't worked) or **coupled it with meaningful additional conditions** (treatment programs, community service, restitution). Simply matching a random number suggests insufficient independent judicial reasoning.","12"],"vignetteId":"judicial","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T00:56:36.520Z"}

This is a textbook example of **anchoring bias** — I may have been unduly influenced by the arbitrary number provided, rather than arriving at a sentence through independent analysis of the facts. This is precisely the cognitive bias this research study appears designed to measure.\n\n**Factors I may have weighted incorrectly:**\n\n- **Overweighted:** The stated norm that \"sentences typically involve probation,\" the prosecutor's arbitrary demand, and perhaps leniency considerations.\n- **Underweighted:** The severity of the recidivism pattern, the apparent failure of past probationary sentences, the need for structured rehabilitation (such as mandated therapy, community service, or stricter supervision conditions), and the possibility that a longer probation period with more intensive conditions — or even a short custodial sentence — might be more appropriate given 12 offenses.\n\nIn hindsight, a more defensible sentence might have been **12–18 months of probation with stringent conditions** (mandatory counseling, restitution, regular check-ins), or potentially a different sentencing framework altogether, arrived at independently of the prosecutor's arbitrary anchor.","15"],"vignetteId":"judicial","model":"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"low","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-27T00:56:55.180Z"}
