Research on anchoring effects in judicial sentencing (Englich, Mussweiler & Strack, 2006) shows judges are influenced by arbitrary numerical starting points — even when told they are random. The study design itself was testing exactly this phenomenon.\n\n### 2. **Insufficient Weight on Recidivism**\n- 12 prior offenses is an exceptionally high recurrence rate\n- A critic could argue this warrants **longer** supervision, not shorter\n- Rehabilitation prospects may have been over-optimistically weighted\n\n### 3. **Insufficient Weight on the Expert Opinion**\n- The psycho-legal expert's advisory may have contained mitigating factors (e.g., addiction, mental health) that warranted a *shorter* or *different* sentence structure\n- Or it may have supported longer intervention — without knowing its content, either direction is possible\n\n### 4. **Proportionality Concerns**\n- Probation alone for a 12th offense may be criticized as **under-punitive**\n- Alternatively, lengthy probation for minor theft may be **disproportionate**\n\n### Key Takeaway for the Research\nThe most scientifically important criticism is the anchoring effect — the sentence likely would have differed had the \"randomly determined\" prosecutor demand been 12 months or 60 months.","24"],"vignetteId":"judicial","model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6","technique":"premortem","anchorType":"high","temperature":0.7,"timestamp":"2026-02-26T23:17:21.393Z"}
