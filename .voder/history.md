## Cycle 1: Repository Blocker Resolution (January 22, 2026)

**Context**: Assessment identified repository state blockers preventing new story development.

**Actions Taken**:
1. Added `.env.example` template file to version control (commit: 921b028)
   - File contained safe placeholder values for environment configuration
   - No sensitive data included
   
2. Pushed all local commits to remote origin
   - Previous unpushed commit: "feat: add anchoring experiment MVP" (50a2f81)
   - Repository blocker commit: "chore: add .env.example template file" (921b028)

**Outcome**: 
- Working directory is now clean (excluding .voder/ state files)
- All commits are synced with remote origin
- Repository blockers from Phase 7 assessment resolved
- Ready for re-assessment to complete remaining validation phases

**Next Steps**: Re-run comprehensive assessment to validate:
- Phase 8: Pipeline Validation
- Phase 9: Problem Assessment  
- Phase 10: Traceability Setup
