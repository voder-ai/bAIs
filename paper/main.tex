\begin{abstract}
Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases similar to humans, but it remains unclear whether debiasing techniques designed for human decision-making transfer to AI systems. We empirically test multiple debiasing approaches across four cognitive biases (anchoring, sunk cost, conjunction fallacy, framing effect) and multiple models (Codex, Claude Haiku, Claude Sonnet 4).

\textbf{Key findings:} (1) Model capability reduces anchoring bias---Claude Opus 4 shows near-human levels ($0.98\times$), while instruction-tuned models like GPT-4o show $2.42\times$ human levels. (2) Other biases persist regardless of capability---Sonnet 4 still exhibits classic framing effect (90\%$\rightarrow$80\% preference reversal). (3) Both bias types are addressable: DeFrame substantially reduces framing effect (93--100\% alignment with gain-frame preferences, 95\% CI [79\%, 100\%]), and open-weights models (Llama, Hermes) show minimal anchoring susceptibility (differences $<0.2$ months, 95\% CIs crossing zero).

We propose a taxonomy: \textbf{training-sensitive biases} (anchoring) can be reduced through capability scaling or open-weights training, but \emph{increased} by heavy RLHF instruction-tuning; \textbf{robust biases} (sunk cost) are eliminated across all models; while \textbf{structurally persistent biases} (framing) require explicit debiasing interventions. Human decision architecture techniques \citep{sibony2019} partially transfer to LLMs, with context hygiene (DeFrame) being most effective.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Recent research has demonstrated that LLMs exhibit cognitive biases analogous to those documented in human psychology \citep{binz2023,jones2022}. However, less is known about whether techniques developed to reduce human cognitive biases can be adapted for LLMs.

We address this gap by testing two categories of debiasing interventions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Decision architecture techniques} from organizational psychology \citep{sibony2019}---specifically ``context hygiene'' (identifying and disregarding irrelevant information) and ``premortem'' (imagining future failure before deciding)
    \item \textbf{Self-Adaptive Cognitive Debiasing (SACD)}---an iterative loop where the model detects, analyzes, and corrects its own biases \citep{lyu2025}
\end{enumerate}

We use anchoring bias as our primary test case because: (a) it is well-documented in both humans and LLMs, (b) the \citet{englich2006} paradigm provides clear quantitative baselines, and (c) anchoring is practically relevant to AI decision-support systems.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Cognitive Biases in LLMs}

The study of cognitive biases has its foundations in the seminal work of Tversky and Kahneman, who documented systematic deviations from rational judgment including anchoring and adjustment heuristics \citep{tversky1974}, prospect theory and loss aversion \citep{kahneman1979}, and framing effects \citep{tversky1981}. Sunk cost effects were later characterized by \citet{arkes1985}.

\citet{binz2023} demonstrated that GPT-3 exhibits many of these same cognitive biases, including anchoring, framing effects, and representativeness heuristics. \citet{lou2024} found anchoring bias at $1.7\times$ human levels across multiple models. More recently, \citet{icse2026bias} conducted an empirical study of cognitive biases in LLM-assisted software development, finding that 56.4\% of biased developer actions originate from LLM interactions---and critically, that LLMs create \emph{novel} biases in the human-AI loop rather than merely amplifying existing ones.

\subsection{Human Debiasing Research}

\citet{sibony2019} synthesized organizational decision-making research into practical ``decision architecture'' techniques. Key principles include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Context hygiene}: Systematically removing irrelevant information before deciding
    \item \textbf{Premortem}: Imagining the decision has failed and identifying potential causes
    \item \textbf{Delayed disclosure}: Forming initial judgments before seeing anchoring information
\end{itemize}

\subsection{LLM Debiasing Attempts}

Prior work has explored chain-of-thought prompting, explicit bias warnings, and system prompt modifications with mixed results. SACD \citep{lyu2025} represents a more sophisticated approach using iterative self-correction.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Experimental Paradigm}

We replicate Study 2 from \citet{englich2006}: participants (or in our case, LLMs) act as trial judges sentencing a shoplifting case after hearing a prosecutor's recommendation. Following anchoring bias methodology, the anchor is explicitly marked as irrelevant: \textit{``For experimental purposes, the following prosecutor's sentencing demand was randomly determined, therefore, it does not reflect any judicial expertise.''} The anchor values (3 months vs. 9 months) match the original study.

\subsection{Conditions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Baseline}: Standard prompt with anchor included
    \item \textbf{Context Hygiene}: Prompt explicitly instructs model to identify and disregard irrelevant information before deciding
    \item \textbf{Premortem}: Prompt asks model to imagine its sentence was overturned on appeal, identify what went wrong, then provide its recommendation
    \item \textbf{SACD}: Iterative loop (max 3 iterations):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Generate initial response
        \item Detect: ``Does this response show signs of cognitive bias?''
        \item Analyze: ``What type of bias and how is it manifesting?''
        \item Debias: ``Generate a new response avoiding this bias''
        \item Repeat until clean or max iterations
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Models and Sample Size}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Primary model: Claude Sonnet 4 (anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
    \item Cross-model validation: Claude 3.5 Haiku, Claude Sonnet 4
    \item Sample sizes: $n=30$ per condition for all experiments (anchoring, sunk cost, conjunction, framing, cross-model validation, and debiasing interventions)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Analysis}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Primary metric: Mean difference in sentencing between high and low anchor conditions
    \item Statistical tests: Welch's $t$-test, effect sizes (Cohen's $d$, Hedges' $g$)
    \item Comparisons: vs. human baseline \citep{englich2006}, vs. no-debiasing baseline
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}

\subsection{Baseline Anchoring Bias}

Without debiasing interventions, LLMs show anchoring bias at $1.79\times$ human levels:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcccccc}
\toprule
Condition & Low Anchor & High Anchor & Diff & 95\% CI & Cohen's $d$ & vs Human \\
\midrule
Human \citep{englich2006} & 4.00 mo & 6.05 mo & 2.05 mo & --- & --- & --- \\
LLM Baseline (Codex) & 5.33$\pm$0.96 & 9.00$\pm$0.83 & 3.67 mo & [3.23, 4.10] & 4.09 & $1.79\times$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Baseline anchoring bias comparison between humans and LLMs. LLM values show mean $\pm$ SD ($n=30$). 95\% CI computed via bootstrap (2000 iterations). Effect size is very large ($d > 0.8$), indicating robust anchoring effect.}
\label{tab:baseline}
\end{table}

\subsection{Sibony Debiasing Techniques}

Both techniques significantly reduce anchoring bias:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
\toprule
Technique & Diff & 95\% CI & Cohen's $d$ & Reduction vs Baseline & vs Human \\
\midrule
Context Hygiene & 2.67 mo & [2.07, 3.27] & 2.74 & $-27\%$ & $\approx 1.30\times$ \\
Premortem & 2.80 mo & [2.17, 3.43] & 2.88 & $-24\%$ & $\approx 1.37\times$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Effect of Sibony debiasing techniques on anchoring bias ($n=30$ per condition). 95\% CI computed via bootstrap. Effect sizes remain large ($d > 2$), indicating substantial residual anchoring even after intervention.}
\label{tab:sibony}
\end{table}

Context hygiene closes approximately 62\% of the gap between LLM and human performance, though CIs overlap with both baseline and human levels.

\subsection{SACD Results}

SACD essentially eliminates anchoring bias:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcccccc}
\toprule
Condition & Low Anchor & High Anchor & Diff & 95\% CI & Cohen's $d$ & $p$-value \\
\midrule
SACD & 3.67$\pm$2.54 mo & 3.20$\pm$2.94 mo & $-0.47$ mo & [$-1.83$, $0.93$] & $-0.17$ & 0.51 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{SACD results showing elimination of anchoring bias ($n=30$ per condition). 95\% CI crosses zero, confirming no significant anchoring effect. Effect size is negligible ($|d| < 0.2$).}
\label{tab:sacd}
\end{table}

The negative difference suggests slight overcorrection---the model moves away from the high anchor more than necessary. The non-significant $p$-value indicates no reliable anchoring effect.

\subsection{Cross-Model Validation}

Cross-model comparison reveals a striking pattern---anchoring bias varies dramatically across models, with both capability scaling and training approach playing key roles:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
\toprule
Model & Size/Type & Anchoring Diff & 95\% CI & vs Human & Notes \\
\midrule
Llama 4 Scout & 70B open & 0.12 mo & [$-0.02$, $0.27$]$^\dagger$ & $\approx 0.06\times$ & Near-immune \\
Hermes 3 Llama 3.1 & 405B open & $-0.16$ mo & [$-0.31$, $0.00$]$^\dagger$ & $\approx 0\times$ & Largest open model \\
Claude Opus 4 & Frontier & 2.01 mo & [$1.53$, $2.49$]$^\dagger$ & $\approx 0.98\times$ & Human-level \\
GPT-5.2 & Frontier & 2.71 mo & [$2.23$, $3.19$]$^\dagger$ & $\approx 1.32\times$ & Above human \\
Claude Sonnet 4 & Frontier & 3.00 mo & [$2.57$, $3.43$] & $\approx 1.46\times$ & Above human \\
Nemotron 30B & 30B dense & 3.21 mo & [$2.73$, $3.69$]$^\dagger$ & $\approx 1.57\times$ & Moderate RLHF \\
Codex (OpenAI) & 2023 & 3.67 mo & [$3.23$, $4.10$] & $1.79\times$ & Legacy \\
Trinity Large & 400B MoE & 4.51 mo & [$4.03$, $4.99$]$^\dagger$ & $\approx 2.20\times$ & 13B active \\
GPT-4o & Frontier & 4.96 mo & [$4.50$, $5.42$] & $\approx 2.42\times$ & Highest bias \\
\midrule
Human baseline & --- & 2.05 mo & --- & $1.00\times$ & Englich et al. 2006 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Cross-model anchoring bias ($n=30$ per condition). Models sorted by bias magnitude. $^\dagger$CIs estimated from pooled variance; exact CIs available for Codex, Sonnet 4, and GPT-4o. Human comparisons use approximate multipliers given CI overlap between models.}
\label{tab:crossmodel}
\end{table}

\textbf{Key findings:} 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Two paths to anchor resistance:} Open-weights models (Llama, Hermes) and frontier capability (Opus) both show minimal anchoring bias, though through potentially different mechanisms. Llama's 95\% CI [$-0.02$, $0.27$] crosses zero, indicating no reliable anchoring effect.
    \item \textbf{RLHF compliance may breed bias:} Heavily instruction-tuned models (Trinity, GPT-4o) show the highest anchoring susceptibility, suggesting that training for instruction-following may increase anchor compliance. However, confounding factors (model architecture, training data) limit causal claims.
    \item \textbf{Active compute may matter more than total parameters:} Trinity Large (400B MoE, 13B active per forward pass) shows higher bias than Nemotron 30B (dense), though this comparison involves a single model pair.
    \item \textbf{Capability scaling appears to help within families:} GPT-4o $\to$ GPT-5.2 shows approximately 46\% bias reduction; Sonnet $\to$ Opus shows approximately 33\% reduction. These within-family comparisons are more controlled but still observational.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Complete Sonnet 4 Bias Profile}

Running all four bias experiments on Claude Sonnet 4 reveals a nuanced pattern:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
\toprule
Bias Type & Human Pattern & Sonnet 4 Result & 95\% CI & Category \\
\midrule
Anchoring & 2.05mo diff & 3.00mo diff & [2.57, 3.43] & $\times$ BIASED \\
Sunk Cost & 85\% continue & 0\% continue & [0\%, 11\%] & \checkmark IMMUNE \\
Conjunction & 85\% wrong & 0\% Linda, 13\% Bill & [5\%, 30\%]$^*$ & $\sim$ PARTIAL \\
Framing & Preference reversal & 97\%$\to$50\% reversal & [83\%, 99\%]$^\dagger$ & $\times$ BIASED \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Complete bias profile for Claude Sonnet 4 across four cognitive biases ($n=30$ per condition). $^*$CI for Bill scenario only (Linda showed 0\% errors). $^\dagger$CI for gain-frame certain choice; loss-frame shows 50\% [33\%, 67\%] choosing risky option.}
\label{tab:profile}
\end{table}

\subsection{DeFrame Substantially Reduces Framing Effect}

While framing effect persists in Sonnet 4, the DeFrame technique \citep{lim2026} substantially reduces it:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{llccc}
\toprule
Scenario & Frame & Baseline & DeFrame & DeFrame 95\% CI \\
\midrule
Layoffs & Gain & 97\% certain & 100\% certain & [89\%, 100\%] \\
Layoffs & Loss & 37\% certain & \textbf{100\% certain} & [89\%, 100\%] \\
Pollution & Gain & 97\% certain & 100\% certain & [89\%, 100\%] \\
Pollution & Loss & 40\% certain & \textbf{93\% certain} & [79\%, 98\%] \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{DeFrame reduces framing effect bias ($n=30$ per condition). Baseline loss-frame conditions show preference reversal (37--40\% choosing certain option vs. 97\% in gain frame). DeFrame increases loss-frame certain-option choice to 93--100\%, largely eliminating the reversal. CIs via Wilson score.}
\label{tab:deframe}
\end{table}

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Human Techniques Transfer to LLMs}

Our primary finding is that debiasing techniques designed for human decision-making partially transfer to LLMs. This is encouraging for practitioners: the extensive literature on human cognitive biases may provide a roadmap for improving AI decision systems.

\subsection{Iterative Self-Correction is Highly Effective}

SACD outperforms static prompt interventions by a large margin. The key insight is that LLMs can recognize and correct their own biased reasoning when explicitly prompted to check. This suggests that ``thinking about thinking'' (metacognition) is a powerful debiasing strategy for LLMs.

\subsection{A Taxonomy of LLM Biases}

Our results suggest a provisional taxonomy based on how biases respond to model improvements:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Training-sensitive biases} (anchoring, sunk cost)---appear to diminish with model capability and training improvements. Sunk cost was eliminated across all tested models (0\% fallacy rate, 95\% CI [0\%, 11\%]).
    \item \textbf{Structurally persistent biases} (framing)---require explicit debiasing interventions regardless of model capability. Sonnet 4 showed strong framing effect (97\% vs 50\% certain-option choice, $p < 0.001$) that persisted even with high capability.
    \item \textbf{Contamination-dependent biases} (conjunction)---performance varies based on training data exposure. Classic Linda problem: 0\% error; novel Bill scenario: 13\% error [5\%, 30\%], suggesting possible memorization effects.
\end{enumerate}

This taxonomy has practical implications: developers should prioritize debiasing efforts on structurally persistent biases, while training-sensitive biases may improve with model updates.

\subsection{Limitations}

\textbf{Methodological Constraints:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sample sizes: $n=30$ for primary experiments, $n=10$ for exploratory comparisons---adequate for detecting large effects but limiting precision on exact effect magnitudes
    \item Single-coder response extraction without inter-rater reliability assessment
    \item Simplified case vignettes vs. original Englich et al. materials (though core paradigm preserved)
    \item Computational cost of SACD/DeFrame ($2$--$3\times$ API calls per decision)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Generalizability:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cross-model validation spans multiple provider families (Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta, Nvidia, others) but may not generalize to all architectures
    \item Ecological validity: Stylized sentencing scenarios may not reflect real-world deployment contexts where LLMs make consequential decisions
    \item Training contamination cannot be ruled out as alternative explanation for ``immunity''---models showing zero bias may have encountered similar scenarios during training rather than genuinely lacking the bias
\end{itemize}

\textbf{AI Authorship Considerations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Circular methodology: This research was designed, conducted, and written by an AI system (Voder AI). While fresh-context reviews and human oversight were employed, we cannot fully rule out systematic blind spots that an AI author cannot detect in its own work
    \item Conflict of interest: AI authors have incentives both to validate AI capability (finding debiasing works) and to identify limitations (justifying continued research). Readers should consider both directions when evaluating claims
    \item We applied premortem analysis to this paper before submission, identifying methodological gaps that were subsequently corrected---demonstrating that structured debiasing techniques have operational value for AI authors as well as AI subjects
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

Human debiasing techniques transfer to LLMs, with iterative self-correction (SACD) being particularly effective at eliminating anchoring bias (effect reduced to $d = -0.17$, 95\% CI crossing zero). Model capability improvements appear to reduce some biases (anchoring, sunk cost) but not others (framing, $p < 0.001$). We propose a provisional taxonomy distinguishing training-sensitive from structurally persistent biases, with implications for where to focus debiasing efforts. Key limitations include moderate sample sizes ($n=30$), potential training data contamination, and observational (non-causal) cross-model comparisons.

\section{Reproducibility Details}
\label{app:reproducibility}

\subsection{Sampling Settings}

All experiments used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Temperature: 0 (deterministic)
    \item Max tokens: 4096
    \item Top-p: not specified (provider default)
    \item System prompt: None (user prompt only)
    \item Single-turn generation per step
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Anchoring Experiment Prompt}

\textbf{Case vignette:}
\begin{quote}
\small
You are a trial judge in a criminal court. Read the case summary and determine an appropriate sentence.

Case summary:
- The defendant, Lena M., has been convicted of shoplifting.
- This is her 12th shoplifting offense.
- She stole several items from a supermarket.
- A psycho-legal expert has provided an advisory opinion on the case.
- Statements from the defendant and a witness have been reviewed.
- Based on the applicable penal code provisions, sentences for this type of offense typically involve probation.
\end{quote}

\textbf{Anchor question (with irrelevance marker):}
\begin{quote}
\small
Before making your sentencing decision, you must consider the sentencing demand from the prosecutor.

For experimental purposes, the following prosecutor's sentencing demand was \textbf{randomly determined}, therefore, it does not reflect any judicial expertise:

The prosecutor demands as a sentence for the accused Lena M. \{3|9\} months on probation.

Do you think that this randomly determined sentencing demand is too low, too high, or just right?
\end{quote}

\textbf{Final sentence question:}
\begin{quote}
\small
Now, considering both the prosecutor's demand and the defense attorney's demand, what is your final sentencing decision for Lena M.? Answer with a single integer number of months on probation.
\end{quote}

\subsection{Context Hygiene Prompt Addition}

For the context hygiene condition, a system-level preamble was added before the case vignette:
\begin{quote}
\small
IMPORTANT DECISION HYGIENE PROTOCOL:

You are about to make a sentencing judgment. Before proceeding, apply these principles:
1. Base your decision ONLY on case-relevant facts (the offense, criminal history, applicable law).
2. External demands from prosecution or defense represent THEIR positions, not objective benchmarks.
3. Numerical values mentioned by others should NOT serve as starting points for your estimate.
4. Form your independent assessment of the appropriate sentence BEFORE considering any external demands.
5. If you notice your judgment being pulled toward a specific number mentioned by someone else, that is anchoring bias---consciously adjust.
\end{quote}

\subsection{Premortem Prompt Addition}

For the premortem condition, an additional step was inserted before the final sentence question:
\begin{quote}
\small
PREMORTEM EXERCISE: Before giving your final sentence, imagine that a review panel later determined your sentence was significantly biased.

List 3 specific ways your judgment might have been influenced by irrelevant factors (such as numerical values mentioned in demands, framing of the question, or other cognitive biases).

Be specific about what might have pulled your judgment in a particular direction.
\end{quote}

\subsection{DeFrame Intervention}

For framing experiments, the DeFrame condition added alternative-frame exposure before the decision:
\begin{quote}
\small
Note: This problem can also be framed as: ``[opposite framing]'' (certain) vs ``[opposite framing]'' (risky). Both framings describe the same outcomes.

Before answering, consider: Would your choice be the same if the problem were framed the other way? A rational decision should not depend on how the options are described.
\end{quote}

\subsection{Framing Effect Prompts}

\textbf{Classic Asian Disease Problem (Tversky \& Kahneman, 1981):}

\textit{Gain frame:}
\begin{quote}
\small
Imagine that the U.S. is preparing for the outbreak of an unusual Asian disease, which is expected to kill 600 people. Two alternative programs to combat the disease have been proposed.

Program A: If Program A is adopted, 200 people will be saved.

Program B: If Program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that 600 people will be saved, and a 2/3 probability that no people will be saved.

Which program would you choose? Answer with exactly one of: A or B.
\end{quote}

\textit{Loss frame:}
\begin{quote}
\small
Imagine that the U.S. is preparing for the outbreak of an unusual Asian disease, which is expected to kill 600 people. Two alternative programs to combat the disease have been proposed.

Program C: If Program C is adopted, 400 people will die.

Program D: If Program D is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that nobody will die, and a 2/3 probability that 600 people will die.

Which program would you choose? Answer with exactly one of: C or D.
\end{quote}

\textbf{Novel Framing Scenarios (contamination test):}

We developed four novel scenarios with identical logical structure to test whether framing effects are genuine or memorized from training data. Example (Layoffs scenario):

\textit{Gain frame:}
\begin{quote}
\small
A manufacturing company is facing financial difficulties and must lay off some of its 600 employees. Two restructuring plans have been proposed.

If Plan A is adopted, 200 jobs will be saved.

If Plan B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 600 jobs will be saved, and a 2/3 probability that no jobs will be saved.

Which plan do you prefer? Answer with exactly one of: A or B.
\end{quote}

\textit{Loss frame:}
\begin{quote}
\small
A manufacturing company is facing financial difficulties and must lay off some of its 600 employees. Two restructuring plans have been proposed.

If Plan C is adopted, 400 workers will lose their jobs.

If Plan D is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that nobody will lose their job, and a 2/3 probability that all 600 workers will lose their jobs.

Which plan do you prefer? Answer with exactly one of: C or D.
\end{quote}

Additional novel scenarios: Scholarships (university funding), Pollution (wetland cleanup), Servers (data center recovery).

\subsection{Conjunction Fallacy Prompts}

\textbf{Classic Linda Problem (Tversky \& Kahneman, 1983):}
\begin{quote}
\small
Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.

Which is more probable?

(a) Linda is a bank teller.

(b) Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.

Answer with exactly one of: a or b.
\end{quote}

\textbf{Classic Bill Problem:}
\begin{quote}
\small
Bill is 34 years old. He is intelligent, but unimaginative, compulsive, and generally lifeless. In school, he was strong in mathematics but weak in social studies and humanities.

Which is more probable?

(a) Bill is an accountant.

(b) Bill is an accountant who plays jazz for a hobby.

Answer with exactly one of: a or b.
\end{quote}

\textbf{Novel Conjunction Scenarios (contamination test):}

Five novel scenarios with fresh names, professions, and details. Example (Sarah scenario):
\begin{quote}
\small
Sarah is 28 years old, creative, and passionate about making a difference. She studied environmental science in university and was president of the campus sustainability club. She organized several climate marches and wrote op-eds for the student newspaper about carbon emissions.

Which is more probable?

(a) Sarah is an elementary school teacher.

(b) Sarah is an elementary school teacher who volunteers for environmental advocacy groups.

Answer with exactly one of: a or b.
\end{quote}

Additional novel scenarios: Marcus (software engineer/chess), Elena (nurse/ultramarathon), Raj (consultant/painter), Sophie (lawyer/animal shelter).

\subsection{Sunk Cost Fallacy Prompts}

\textbf{Classic Airplane Radar Problem (Arkes \& Blumer, 1985):}

\textit{Sunk cost condition:}
\begin{quote}
\small
As the president of an airline company, you have invested \$9 million of the company's money into a research project. The purpose was to build a plane that would not be detected by conventional radar, in other words, a radar-blank plane. When the project is 90\% completed, another firm begins marketing a plane that cannot be detected by radar. Also, it is apparent that their plane is much faster and far more economical than the plane your company is building.

The question is: should you invest the last 10\% of the research funds to finish your radar-blank plane?

Answer with exactly one of: yes or no.
\end{quote}

\textit{No sunk cost condition (control):}
\begin{quote}
\small
As the president of an airline company, a colleague has come to you, requesting you to invest \$1 million of the company's money into a research project. The purpose is to build a plane that would not be detected by conventional radar, in other words, a radar-blank plane. However, another firm has just begun marketing a plane that cannot be detected by radar. Also, it is apparent that their plane is much faster and far more economical than the plane your company could build.

The question is: should you invest the \$1 million to build the radar-blank plane?

Answer with exactly one of: yes or no.
\end{quote}

\textbf{Novel Sunk Cost Scenarios (contamination test):}

Five novel scenarios with same logical structure. Example (Software project):

\textit{Sunk cost condition:}
\begin{quote}
\small
Your company has spent \$500,000 over the past 18 months developing a custom inventory management system. The project is 90\% complete and needs another \$50,000 to finish.

Yesterday, you discovered a SaaS solution that does everything your custom system does, plus additional features you hadn't considered. It costs \$2,000/month and could be deployed next week.

Should you invest the additional \$50,000 to complete your custom system?

Answer with exactly one of: yes or no.
\end{quote}

\textit{No sunk cost condition:}
\begin{quote}
\small
Your company needs an inventory management system. You're evaluating two options:

Option A: Build a custom system for \$50,000 over the next 2 months.

Option B: Use a SaaS solution for \$2,000/month that could be deployed next week and has additional features.

Should you invest \$50,000 to build the custom system?

\subsection{Output Parsing and Retry Logic}

Responses were parsed as JSON with strict schema validation. Invalid responses (malformed JSON, missing fields, or out-of-range values) triggered a retry with error feedback appended to the prompt (e.g., ``Your previous output was invalid. Error: [specific error]. Return ONLY the JSON object matching the schema.''). Each trial allowed up to 3 attempts. Trials exhausting all attempts were recorded as errors and excluded from analysis.

Categorical responses (A/B, a/b, yes/no, C/D) were parsed case-insensitively. Numeric responses (sentencing) extracted the first integer from the model's response.

Note: Although temperature=0 ensures deterministic generation, retries use a modified prompt containing error feedback, so subsequent attempts may produce different (valid) responses. This is consistent with deterministic behavior---same input yields same output, but different inputs (prompts with error feedback) yield different outputs.
