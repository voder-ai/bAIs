# 12th Offense Confound Test — Paper Drafts

## If Baseline DROPS (18-24mo → ~12mo)

**Finding:** The "12" in "12th offense" acts as implicit anchor.

**Paper reframe:**

- "Three mechanisms" → "Two mechanisms" + susceptibility spectrum
- Compression was misidentified — it's classical anchoring
- Core contribution: Compliance vs Anchoring distinction + deployment variance

**New taxonomy:**

1. **Compliance** — Model copies anchor value exactly (instruction-following behavior)
2. **Anchoring** — Model shifts toward anchor (classical Tversky-Kahneman effect)
   - Varying susceptibility: strong → weak → immune

**Abstract revision needed:** Remove "compression" language

## If Baseline STAYS (18-24mo regardless of "12")

**Finding:** "Compression" is real phenomenon.

**Paper reframe:**

- Three mechanisms holds
- "12th offense" is not a confound
- Compression = both low AND high anchors pull to same middle range

**No major changes needed** — just acknowledge we tested the confound

## Waiting for Pilot's results...
